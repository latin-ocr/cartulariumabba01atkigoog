IN TRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. xxvii

under the Norman occupation for the restoration of the one-
time famous Religious House of Eastern Cleveland. Reinfrid
is named as the first restorer, and then as the first Prior of the
restored House. He is described in the Memorial as having
been an active soldier in the Conqueror’s service—‘⁸ miles
strenuissimus in obsequio domini sui Willelmi Nothi, Regis
Anglorum '’—and as having turned aside from the direct line of
a Journey, or march, through N orthumbria in order to visit
Whitby, where he was struck with compunction at the sight of
the desolation caused by the ravages of “ the merciless pirates,
Ingwar and Ubba‚ leaders of the Danes.” There is a species of
suppression here which is. rather amusing. Domesday also
speaks of the desolation caused in and near Whitby, under the
ravages of a leader of the N ormans, and it says of 28 carucates,
averaging probably 100 acres each, “ pene omnia wasta ”—the
only exceptions being the Church-lands held by the Abbot of
York in Prestebi and Sourebi. It may have been a tacit con-
sciousness on the part of the memorialist which held his pen,
making him feel that it might be quite as well to leave the
immediate authors of the nearer, or more recent, wasting
unnamecL N ay, it may very well be, even, that Reinfrid
himself—“ strenuissimus miles in obsequio domini sui '’—knew
only too much about the ravages of the Conqueror, and might
have good personal reason for compunction. Any way, he
became a monk at Evesham, and there was well trained in
monastic practice and discipline. After a space he returned
into N ort-humbria with the clearly conceived design of reviving
monastic religion there, and, coming eventually to William de
Perci, was well received by him, and put into a favourable
position for carrying out his plans by a grant at that baron's
hands of “ the ancient monastery of S. Peter the Apostle,
together with two carucates of land in Prestebi, as a perpetual
alms.'’ In no long time several others, like-minded with him-
self, were collected together, and the new Abbey, in some sense
or other, ‘became a fact. The precise date of the commenced
restoration is not known 3 but, according to Dr. Young, it could
not be later than 1078 ; for “in that year Reinfrid was joined
by one Stephen, who afterwards became Abbot of York, and is
usually called Stephen of Whitby, because Whitby was the
place at which he began the monastic life.”
