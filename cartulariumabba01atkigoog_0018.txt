xiv ΙΝ TRODUGTORY CHAPTERS.

For myself, after a good deal of patient investigation be-
stowed upon the derivation of the place-names of the district,
Ι have no doubt that the first element in the name is what so
large a majority of the prefixes in our local nomenclature
clearly are, and that is the name of a person. Such a name
existed in the eleventh century, in the form of an agnomen or
nickname—Mr. Freeman calls it a surname—in the case of
Edric Streone, and we find it as a prefix in the name Streon-
bercht, which occurs in the Liber Vitae. But as to the meaning
of the suffix, that is clearly uncertain. There can be little
doubt, however, that -healch, -halch, or -halc, is the true form,
and Ι look upon the forms -ῙιαΖΙι, ·ΙιεαΖΙι, -heale, quoted by
Young, as merely worn forms, or, in other wordS, forms from
which the c has dropped out by usage. While, from the occur-
rence of the same suffix in a local name met with in some
early documents contained in the Whitby Chartulary, in the
twofold forms -Izalc, -halff Ι am inclined to think that the
final 011 was dealt with in pronunciation precisely as it was—
and is—-in other words in which it is found ; and I specify
Old Anglian yruch, which is printed “ grudge ’' in our Prayer-
book version of the Psalms, and is sounded yruff in the Cleve-
land vernacular.² And if this be so, it is as nearly certain as
can be that there may be a close connection, if not a perfect
identity, between the -halch in Bede’s “ Streanaeshalch,’' and
the word of such common occurrence in North Britain, which

nearly 88 1101ιῇ 18.

And in support of this view I would remark that the name
Streanaeshalch or Streoneshalc waS, beyond all doubt, applied
to the site of the 'Monastery—that is, to the level space
environed on two sides by the steep precipices of the cliffs
whereon Hilda’s “ Holy house ’' undoubtedly stood. For there
is no question that, at the period of Domesday, Whitby—then
written Witebi—and Prestebi were two distinct placeS. In-
deed, soke of the latter appertained to the Manor of Witebi.
