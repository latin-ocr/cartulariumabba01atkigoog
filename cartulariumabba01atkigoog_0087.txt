make the suggested hypothesis even moderately plausible. But
it would seem to be otherwise with the supposition that pos-
sibly this sacrifice of rights, so highly prized as were the forest-
rights which were surrendered to Henry, may have been made
conditionally on the erection of an Abbacy in place of what
before had been only a Priory. It will be remarked too that
Henry's chart-er is an ex post facto one——“ et ego illos forestavi
michi et haeredibus meis.” Not only has the concession been
made by the monkS, but the King has already acted upon it,
by taking all the formal proceedings necessary towards consti-
tuting the forests in question a part of the Royal forests—
proceedings which were not reversed, it may be observed, until
the reign of John, when the reversal was effected by another
special charter (No, 191).

Whether the suggestion thus made involves or implies the
explanation of the remarkable surrender by the Convent of all
its extensive and important forest-rights to the King or not,
must be a matter left to the consideration and judgment of
such as read these remarks and look upon them as worth enter·
taining3 but there is yet another matter for notice, not entirely
unconnected, and already glanced at,¹ which may as well be
mooted here. Ι mean that in the existing documents we have
many tokens of rearrangement of sees or of portions of feeS,
some dependent on a change in the tenant in capite, others on
possible exchange or sale, or, it may be, even on an entirely
new grant.

Thus it is quite evident that, at the date of the charter by
William de Perci, to which not only his wife, Emma de Port,
but specially his son and heir, Alan de Perci, is a party,
william de Perci himself, as is the case with his son Alan
quite early in Henry's reign, has become tenant in capite, al-
though we have no hint as to the time or the manner in which
he had become sc, or as to any consideration or compensation
made to Earl Hugh on that account. But independently of
this, which could only have been brought about by the direct
consent and co·operation of the King, we find in the same
charter evidences of further change, involving similar royal
action of even a more direct kind still. In the extract from
Domesday given above we have a notice‘ of the manor of
