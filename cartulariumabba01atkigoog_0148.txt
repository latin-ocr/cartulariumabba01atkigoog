“116661666 fabric” indeed. 0116111611 (p. 135) says—“As 161 1116 01161611 61
Saxeby, mentioned in the 1616361113 61161161, . . . Ι am made to conclude
that we are to look for Saxeby in South Fyling 3 and what confirma me 16
11116 69161611 16, 1116 foundation 616 61161611 61 6116961 having only 6 few years
ago been (163 69 111616 611 1116 (1611166116 lands 61 Sir 01161166 Η61116111, Β611.,
6116616 in a field or 361111 called the 0116961-361111 . . . which 1 am pretty
confident is the very 91666 given to Whitby Abbey in the above charter.”
Yonng (p. 376, 11616) 6661166611113 on this, writes— ‘⁶ Charlton’s idea that
Saxeby was in South Fyling, where there was a field called Ultapd-qoerth on
the Hotham estates, 16 by no means improbable, only we must suppose, in
that 6666, 11161 Saxeby Church was suppressed by our monks, being never
otherwise mentioned. Still Ι am more inclined to reckon this 61161611, 66
well 66 Flemesburg, the same with Fyling.'’ No lengthy commenta 616
required in connection with 111666 remarks. There is 66 uncertainty 66 16
1116 91666 where Saxeby 16 16 116 looked 161. Τ116 rubricated heading 61 the
present 61161161, by 116 explicit notificatiom ‘⁸ de Sudfilinga,‘' settles 11161
question 61 once. Saxeby is in South Fyling or nowhere, and 11 11 were
otherwise, Fleinesburg cannot be tortured into Flemesburg. That 011611-
ton’s supposition 66 to 1116 6116 61 Saxeby Church or Chapel is well founded
is nearly certain. The position, 1116 foundations, and the 1161116 61 1116 6116
611 lend confirmation 16 11, and it may further be noted that the site is hard
by Kirk Moorgate, and that Kirk Moor 6611166 61666 69 16 1116 666166616
named Chapelgnrth. (Ο. Μ69, No. 46, six-inch scale.) The idea 61 “ sup-
91666166, ” started and repeated by Young, 16 3161611666. Probably twenty
or thirty 61169616 in Cleveland have disappeared precisely in the same way
as Saxeby Chapel 1166, some 61 which have had a very distinct history, but
none 61 which now have more memorial than the names 61 their sites,
Chapel Field, Chapel Garth, Chapel Hm, and so forth.
