who had ιο render the service of making the Homgarth is effectually dis-
posed of. It was Alexander de Percy’s ‘⁴ men '’ (homines), and not himself,
who had to do the work. That the hedge or fence, whatever its object, and
substantially made, as we have seen, began or ended near the place where
the present farcical sticking in of small sticks is performed is not at all im·
probable ; and that it was of dimensione and extent adequate to the purposes
for which hedges made of strong stakes, with wattled brushwood between,
are usually constructed‚ is quite beyond doubt. Taking into consideration
the time of year at which the work had to be done, there can, it seems, be
but little doubt that it was the customary annual restoration of the fence of
the common arable lande of the Abbey, after the completion of the spring-
sowing, and that the fence was one designed to resist the incursione of
horned cattle as well as of sheep, goats, and swine. It is reasonable to sup·
pose that in the vicinity of such a town as Whitby undoubtedly grew to be
under the Abbey, and particularly when we bear in mind the many special
permissions conceded to the Abbey ιο enclose the land granted to them, if so
they desired, the need for such annual restoration would grow less and
less, and disappear long before it did in more country places. But the service
itself, and its name, would still remaiu (as is the case to this day with not a
few feudal services in many parts of the kingdom), and notwithstanding tho
formal relaxation which evidently took place, or perhaps because of that
very relaxation,‘ at some time in the sixteenth century probably, a myth
would be invenwd to account for both one and the other. As to the name
itself, as a name only z—of course the Abbot’s bailiff may have formally sum-
moned the service-bound builders of the hedge by sound of horn, aud the ’
old horn itself remains to attest the antiquity of the custom, in its existing
form, by its frail and battered condition ς albeit there is nothing about the
said horn to suggest a greater antiquity than, it so great as, that assigned a
few lines above to the legend itself. It may possibly be a sixteenth century,
it certainly is not a twelfth century, relic. If the Abbot's bailiff did thus
formally summon the builders—although there is no reference ιο the fact in
the record oi the settlement with Alexander de Percy, and although it is
quite certain from the same record that the actual, or dc facte, summons or
warning was otherwise made—ior de Percy’s men often made a claim to
have a thme days’ warning—the name might so originate. But it is not
likely. And certainly it is at least as likely that its first clement came from
the horned stock—and the great quantities of horus that have been dug up
in the Monastery kitchen-midding, at the foot of the bank on the Abbey side
of Church Street,amply show that, and how, the said stock were berned-which
pastured over the stubbles after harvest was gathered in, and the hitherto
protecting hedges pulled down, and which were again excluded on the return
of spring from the newly-sown lands by renewed or repaired fences in each
returning year.
