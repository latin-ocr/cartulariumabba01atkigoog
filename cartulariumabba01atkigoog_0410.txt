314 CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

Et praedictus Willelmus de Percy de[dit] Abbathiae de
Whytteby totum solum (129b) de Tordsaybek, quae est subtus
castrum de Mulgref‚ currens in mare, usque Tyllaybeke qui est
subtus Ravenclyf juxta manerium de Semar, quod est manerium
Domini de Percy-exceptis sex carucatis terrae—videl. ii caru·

carucatae terrae erant donatae Abbathiae praedictae per Willelmum
conquestorem, prout notatur in quodam Inspeximus domini
Edwardi Regis} filii Edwardi Regis, de diversis donationibus
dictae Abbathiae factis.

Item sunt in Dunceley iiii carucata} terrae de feodo de Percy

quas dictus Abbas tenet.

Et idem Willelmus de Percy, fundator dictae Abbathiae,
genuit Alanum de Percy, et Ricardum fratrem ejus; et idem
Alanus confirmavit cartam patris sui, et obiit sine haerede de
corpore su0,2 et sepultus [est] apud Whytteby3 et sic descendit

brethren, and was not only removed from his seat, but fined in the sum
oi three thousand marks (Weever‚ 367 3 Boe. Parl. i. 52-63), he is described
in a document (Bab. Coa. Claud. 1. viii. p. 206) as entirely innocenb—‘in
quo dolus seu fraus non est inventus’—and as paying a fine to conciliate
the King. He was alive in 28 Edw. 1.‚ when he was defendant in an action
brought against him for damage done to property in Hemingham in Norfolk
(Abb. Placit‚ 242).’'—(Foes’ Judyea qs Enyland, p. 577.) 1 have not been able
to discover the “ Quo Warranto '’ named. ² See No. 582.

² This, in the face of such documentary evidence as is afforded in No. 1
(p. 4), ‘⁴ ex dono Will. de Percy, filii Alani de Porci, advocati nostri ;’' No. 26,
by william de Perci, who in it speaks of ‘⁴ Emma de Port, mater Alani de
Perci, patris mei, ” and of Walter de Percy, ‘⁴ irater meus ς ” No. 55, “Will.
de Perci, filii Alani de Perci ; '’ No. 187, Richard the First’s confirmation of
“omnes donationes will. de Perci, fundatoris, et Alani de Perci, filii ejus,
et Will. de Porci, filii Alaniss’ etc. ; to say nothing of such other documenta
as Nos. 59 and 211, wherein Alan de Perci, the grantor, speaks of his father
Alsa, and of his brothers william, Walter, Gaufrid and Henry—and there
are others like—in the face of such documenta-y evidence this statement in
the text is simply astounding; and so is the following one, that Alan having
no issue “ the inheritance descended to Richard (de Porci, de Dunseley) his
brother, as heir to the said Alan.'' But that which next ensues‚ viz„
that “ this Richard neither gave nor confirmed anything” to the Abbey is
not much less surprising, as he is the first donor mentioned in the Memorial
after the founders (William and Alan) and Emma de Port, as bestowing
‘⁴ duas partes decimae bladi de dominio de Stachestune '' (p. 3), and from

Kirkby's Inque-ac it appears (p. 52) that there were six carticates of the Percy
see at this place, held of Gilbert de Gaunt. ,
