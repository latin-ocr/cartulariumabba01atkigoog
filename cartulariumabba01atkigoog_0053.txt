IN TRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. xlix

But further, evenis we were not prepared to find charters
of confirmation by William 1., the names we meet with in this
charter—two of them (without including those of Archbishop
Thomas and William de Perci) viz„ Earl Alan and Ralph
Paganel, having been already met with in the Earl of Chester’s
charter to Reinfrid—and the use of the local name Prestebi
would at once lead us ιο assign an earlier date than that of the

reign of the second William ιο the document ; and this ιοο, with-
out specially noting the presence of Lausi-ane, who died in May

1089, Earl Alan himself having died the preceding year. And
besides, the general character of the charter itself, as well as of
that just now referred to as ascribed to William the Conqueror
in both chartularies—Charlton says of it that it “ contains as
ample and extensive privileges as it was in the power of any
English King to grant ’'——taken in connection with the Red
King's notorious character, is such as ιο make it a priori
tolerably certain that the gifts and charters in question were
the father's and not the εειοιιέ.1

That William Rufus was, however, in one instance a bene·
factor ιο Whitby it is of course not intended to dispute. He
is mentioned once and again in the existing Whitby records as
the donor of the Church of All Saints in Fishergate at York,
with a special condition attached ; ² and although no copy of

¹ In reference ιο his granta to St. Mary's at York, Mr. Freeman says
(Nm-m. Conquest, iv. 666 n.), ‘⁸ In 1088 the house found a strange benefactor
in William Rufus.'’ In fact this King's systematic tyranny over and robbery
oi the Church is in the mouth of every historiari of his times, and their
words are summat-ised in much the same terms by Freeman, Green and
Stubbs (Nm-man Gonq. v. 72, 75, 136, etc„ Hister-y qt· the Daulida People,
86, etc.. oonotiwt. Hister-y, 297·300). During the short time of the con-
tinuance of Lanirmc’s life after William's accession, his vices and oppressione,
sacrilegious and other, were kept under some little restraint, though even
Lansranc himself was compelled to remonstrate with him on his conduct,
in respect of the Church among other things ; but, the Archbishop removed,
he broke entirely loose from all sanctione of decency even, and much more
of right and respect for even the most sacred claime. Such a man was not
very likely to make grant after grant to a religione house such as Whitby
then was, and indeed, except on the ground suggested by Freeman, it would
be hard to account for his unquestioned gift of All Saints Church at York.
