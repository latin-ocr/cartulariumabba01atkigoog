were only assenting in what they did to his counsel and eom-
mand, imposed the direction or government (“ procurationem '’)
of the entire monastery on Stephen’s shoulders3 and, although
he manifested long-continued unwillingness and opposition,
eventually, and in obedience alike to the command of the King
and the two Archbishops‚ chose him—not simply for their
Prior, but—their Abbot.

Now, either Symeon of Durham and the Whitby Memo-
rialist are utterly and entirely mistaken in their statements, or
the alleged narrator of the above story is making mis—state-
ments: and, of course, if we look upon the narrator as also
certainly the actor, inasmuch as he tells the story in the first
person, he makes them knowingly and purposely. He makes
Reinfrid go to J arrow to lead the life of a solitary. Symeon
states that he was not allowed to leave Evesham on any other
condition save that he and Elfwy both should be under the
control and spiritual charge of Aldwine3 and when he goes to
Jarrow he goes on just the same conditions. A monastery,
with its band of brethren, having been constituted there, two of
the brethren set forth again “ to work a like work elsewhere,
the Lord assisting them,” and, in the sequel, Reinfrid with-
draws from his companion to go to Whitby; where, receiving
those who came to him, he commences the institution of a
monastic settlement. The alleged Stephen makes him go there,
as to J arrow, simply out of special desire to lead a solitary life,
and with no reference to any ulterior monastic project at all.

But, again, the alleged Stephen describes himself as assuming
the monastic habit at Whitby, having gone thither after Rein-
frid had already gathered together, “ under himself as Master
and Prior,'' a considerable number of monks, and habituated
them to the rule of religious living. Notwithstanding which,
raw novice as he, Stephen, was himself ; tried, practised,
trained, experienced as Reinfrid was, by his Evesham initia-
tion, by his maturer J arrow endeavours and labours and
successes, by his still further continuanee in the same toils and
cares at Whitby; the whole brotherhood, with Reinfrid at their
head, and at Reinfrid’s suggestion and desire moreover, solicit
the former to become their head and ruler‚ and elect him not
simply into the place assumed to be vacated by Reinfrffl, but
