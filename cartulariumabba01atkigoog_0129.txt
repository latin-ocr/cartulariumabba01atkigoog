‹S.S.), p. 115, we read—‘⁴ Haec querimonia, facte Eboraci, medis ferme Qus·
dragesims, replicatur paulo post in ebdomada Psscbsli, feris iv. idus Aprilis,
Duuelmi, coram magno conventu principalium virorum, qui tunc forte prop-
ter negotia. quaedsm illuc confluxerunt, scil. Rodbertus de Brys, Alanus de
Perceio, walterus Espec, Forno fil' Ligulfi, Robertus de Witvils, Odsrd
Vicecomes Northymbrensium, cum majoribus ejusdem Comitatus, aliique
quamplures. Corum horum frequentia cum suas Monachi depromerent
querelas, ecce, Harnoldus de Perceio, vir genere et divitiis notus, et in
veritate asserenda constans, exurgens, in testimonium veritatis affirmabat
coram omnibus, etc.” This testimony to the importsncs of the position held
by Ernald de Perci, and the estimation in which he was held, is worthy of
note, ss also is the fact that though undoubtedly s connection of the great
Percies who founded snd endowed Whitby—his name frequently appears ss
that of s witness to important documsnts executed by them—yet he is, un·
like Pichot de Pei-cy and his descendants, not s subfeudstory of theirs, but
of the Brus family. There is little or no doubt that, at the date oi the
foundation of Gysburne, and probably for several years anterior to it, he
was, and had been, lord of the Kildsle fes, and no doubt st all that he was
the founder of the Kildsle family. The charters, executed by himself, his
sons, and other linesl descendants, copies of which sre contained in the
Gysburne chartulary, prove this to demonstration, and effectually dispose
of the frequently relmted, but utterly groundless, so-eaned genealogical
statements which attempt to derive the Kildale Pei-cies from the Whitby
stock, through Walter, son of Alan, and grandson of william hote les Ger-
nuns, the founder oi Whitby.
