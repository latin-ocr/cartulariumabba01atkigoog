Sciant omnes audientes has litteras quod eg0, Au[d]oene,⁸
et uxor mea, Romilda‚ atque haer. meus, Hug0‚ dedimus Ec-
clesiae S. Petri de Wytebi, pro salvatione animarum nostrarum,
cunctorumque nostrorum parentum, unam mansuram t’rae in
Walbagata,⁴ liberam et immunem ab omni servitio in perp„
exceptis quatuor denariis, qui dabuntur ad servitium Regis
per annum3 et illam obtulimus per unum baculum super
altare S. Petri, multis intuentibus, quorum hii testes sunt.

whom and his family see notes to No. 220) was a contemporary of Abbot
William de Porci, who is supposed to have died about 1127 (N 0. 263), and
with Abbot Benedict‚ who resigned in 1148 (No. 220), which would make
him to be a very old man in 1170. Moreover, he was, with his father, a
witness to Alan de Perci's confirmation to Whitby oi the Fyling vills
bought οἱ Tancardus Flandrensis by Abbot william de Perci (Nos. 28, 405),
which carries us still further back towards the beginning oi the twelfth
century.

¹ Possibly an uncle of the last witness.

² ‘⁸ de Soureby ” supplied from M.

³ M. Audoeuus. Some particulare as to Audoen and his family are ob·
tained from three or four different entries in the Memorial (pp. 5, 6) :—
“ Hugo filius Audoeui unam mansuram quae fuit Wulfhet Fabri ;'' ‘⁴ ex dono
Audoeni unam mansuram iu Walbagate, quam tenet Hugo, filius ejus ;” “ ex
dono Godefridi et Turgisii duas mansuras in Usegate, quas tenuerunt de
nobis Orm et Audoenus‚ et nune tenet Hugo filius ej us ;” ‘⁴ ex dono Gaufridi,
filii praed. Audoeni, quandam terram et oedificia quae tenet Hugo frater ejus.”
It thus appears that, besides the mansura which is the subject of the present
deed, Hugo, son of Audoen, holds also the mansura which used to belong to
Wulfhet Faber, also two mansurae in Ousegate, and likewise some other
land and buildings formerly his brother Geoffoey's, and given by him to the
Abbey. From the confirmation of Pope Eugenius 11. (No. 149), Audoen‚
or, as he is therein named, Outhan, had given his donation by or before 1144.
