² From the return by william de Percy of the knights intended in his
fec, early in the reign of Henry 1.‚ printed above (p. 31), it ie seen that
william de Argentum held one knight’s see in Upleatham and Lofthus.
From the Memor-iai (p. 7) it appears that Robert de Argentom was the
original donor of the two bovates mentioned in this chatet, which identifies
him aa the father of william de Argentom‚ the granter. But there was
also an early benefactor of Whitby in the person of Walter de Argentom,
who gave two bovates in South Lofthouse‚—the entry in the Memorial
(p. 7) being, “ ex dono walt„ de Argentom et will. de Perci de Dunesleia et
Aalizoe matris suae.” From No. 74 it appears that Walter de Argentom
had been Athaliza or Aaliza's first husband3 as also that che had been the
actual donor of the two bovatee in Lofthus. whence the infer-enee ie that
it was out of her dower‚ as South Lofthus was in the Percy fee from a very
early period. Cotemporary with the grantor of No. 74, Athaliza’s son,
william de Percy, by Richard of Duneley, was Richard de Argentom de
Lofthouse (see N 0. 363), which gives colour- to the supposition that there
was issue to the marriage of Walter de Argentom and Athaliza. There are
several other char-tere by member-e of the Argentum family, as connected
with Uplium or Upleatham, notably Noc. 72, 217, and 422, the last of which
ie in close connection with the present, ae well ae with ite gmntor. The
memorandum printed ιι N ο. 425 traces the deecent of the Uplithurn land
from the william de Argentum of the present chartei· through his three
grand-daughters to their several hunbaudum but it is to be obser-ved that in
