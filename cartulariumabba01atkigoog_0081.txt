That Reinfrid died Prior Ι think there can be no reasonable
doubt whatever; that Serlo de Percy joined the Whitby com-
munity as a monk during Reinfrid’s rule (the donation just
named being then made), seems to me equally little a matter of
doubt; and that on Reinfrid’s death Serlo de Percy succeeded
to the Priorate can scarcely be questioned. Nor can any great
space of time be allowed for the effecting of the said successione,
as Serlo's name appears in both confirmations by the Conqueror.
But this fact testifies not only in some measure as to the date
at which Serlo must have become Prior, it speaks also in
intelligible terms as to the weight and influence already attach-
ing to the Monastery and its acknowledged head, independently
of that belonging to the Founder, which no doubt would also be
employed in procur-ing such confirmations and grants. N or is
it only thus that we are enabled to recognise the growing
importance of the Whitby Foundation and its Superior, for we
have other pregnant proofs of the same in important donations
made to the Monastery, and Serlo as its Prior, by men of
consideration and importance. Such specially was the gift
by Uchtred de Alverstain, filius Gospatric (No. 108), of two
carucates of land in Chaitun (Cayton), one of the witnesses to
whose charter is Serlo himself ;¹ and, to specify but one other
instance, that of Aaliza de Percy (niece of the Founder and of
Serlo) and her first husband, Hugo de Boitorp.

Now, reference has been made at a former page to the distinct
statement of the Memorialist, that Serlo de Percy continued in
the office of Prior until William de Percy, nephew of the Founder,
was created Abbot, and to the possibility that this transaction
—regarded in the light of supersession of the uncle in favour
of the nephew—might perhaps afford some measure of explana-
tion as to the alleged variance between William de Percy the
Founder and his brother, Prior Ser10.

² Another witness is a man whose name is perhaps the most remarkable
in the entire Chat-tulary, as retaining its Scandinavian form walter-ed, via,
Arne Grimssune. The charter is also remarkable as establishing a eoncession
on the part of the monks themselves, thus explaining the occurrence of the
Prior’s name at the head of the other witnesses—“ concesserunt vero mihi
jam dieti monachi ut sim frater praedicti eoenobii,” fully and entirely, and
that the grantor shall be received and united to the Order whenever he may

come, and with whatever amount of property, “parva seu magna,'’ he may
present himself.
