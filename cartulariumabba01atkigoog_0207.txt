but how many still remain may be seen in the sheets of the Ordnance Sur-
vey, and still more in the estate-books of the various owners, and learnt from
the mouths of their different tenants. It would indeed be strange if it were
not so ; for, to give but one illustr-aion, md that from the township mainly
concerned in the present charter, the Gisburn chartei-s per ee affor-d a list of
scarcely less than ninety local names in the towmhip oi Ormsby alone. All
the local names mentioned in this deed are found there, once, οι· several
times. Laddegate is in Marton ; Buirtrekolde, Buirtrekeldehirst, N orthlang-
peselandes, Westlangpeselandes, as well as Peselondes simply, are also found
in that township, and the 150 names of the kind given for these two town·
ships only might affor-d material for an interesting and insti-notive essay.
Buirtrentub·-in the present vernacular ‘⁶ Bo‘ttrestub” (elder-stub)—tells its
own tale; but it is comparatively silent beside such names as Buirtrekelde·
hirst, Elvescarebree, Uverneudie, Uverblalandes‚ Bradderbremwith, Mile-
merke, and numbers of others3 while such a word as Markemot-—met with
in two chartei-s once belonging to Wykeham Priory, and lent to the editor
by the Dowsger Viseountess Downe-eonneeted with the pax-ish of Wyke·
ham, is of singuhu· interest, and that of interest in divers connections.

¹ This name very probably indicates the site of an ancient settlement of
‘⁴ hut-pits.” In the township of Danby the name Kettle, or Bell-kettle, ie
attached to a strange-looking lengthy boumv, or deep depression, which is
simply dne to geologieal subsidenee. The bottom of it has sunk nearly a
foot vertically during the winter of 1878-9.
