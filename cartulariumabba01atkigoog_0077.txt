by Stephon, and on the suggested motives, himself being more-
over a man possessed of temporal weight and influence‚ a
possible and much more than merely plausible explanation is
suggested not only as to the actual foundation of the alleged
varianae, or rather hostility, between William de Perci and
Stephon, but also as to the subinfeudation of the latter to the
former at Prestebi and Sourebi. It is clear that Stephen
possessed influence enough to obtain a grant from the King
in capite of two carucates at Lestingham and two more at
Apeltun. It may be, perhaps is probable, that these grants
were obtained in transitu, so to speak, between Whitby and
York, and that on his translation to York as Abbot of the
infant House of St. Mary, they were continued and confirmed to
him in that character3 and also that William ‹le Perci, contem-
poraneously with his acquisition of the said grantS, may have
seen good reason to constitute him his own feudatory at
Whitby, to the extent and in the way indicated by the Domes-

day returns.¹

‘⁸ Ad hoe manerium pertinet i carucata terrae in Fometorp.”

The Lestingeham entry is noteworthy. There can be no doubt that the
construction Ι have put upon it is the correct one, for there is one precisely
similar on the following page, viat—‘⁸ In Wnsromi (Wssrnsnmo) habuit
'I'orbrand v car. t’rae ad gelduni. Nune habet Berengarius ibi iiii villanos
cum i caruca, etc.’' But it is to be remarked that in the Recapitulation‚

κ on p. lxxxivb, the enti-y touching Lastingham is, “ In Lestingham ii car.

(Abbas); ibid. i car. (Ber. de Todeni)''—an entry which does not occur in the
previous enumeration of the various manors, etc„ comprised in the several
sees. The same is true of the almost adjoining entry of ‘⁸ Apeltun ii car.
(Abbas),'' not to mention other instances of lands which were indisputably
ehureh lands. The entry on this same page touching Chirchebi is, ‘⁸ In
Cherchebi et alia cherchebi vii ear. B. Todeni, et Abbas de eo ;’' the other
maneria named in the extu-acts above given being named merely as in the
fee of de Todeni, his sub-feudatory the Abbot not being named at all.

¹ It is abundantly certain that there was some hesitation or uncertainty
as to the actual fee of the Abbot of St. Mary's at the Domesday date. Of
what nature this hesitation or uncertainty was, or how it came to exist, ean
