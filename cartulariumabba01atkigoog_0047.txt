years thus spent, he is further stated to have lost his life by an
accident, while assisting some workmen in the construction of a
bridge over the Derwent, at a place called Ormesbridge.

Symeon’s narrative, however meagre in its details, up to the
period of Reinfrid’s death, is not inconsistent with all this.
He simply says that Reinfrid received those who, after his
arrival at Whitby‚ came to him with the object of embracing a
monastic life 3 adding this however at that point, that after his
death they removed to York, and founded there the Abbey of
St Mary’s, “ which,” he concludes, “is now energetically ruled
by Abbot Stephen.''

But Stephen’s narrative would appear to be irreconcilably
inconsistent with this history3 indeed, directly contradictory in
some of its details. Before, however, proceeding to notice it
more precisely, it may be not inexpedient to try and ascertain
whether the charters themselveS, or any among them, add any-
thing to our stock of information. And, at the outset, Ι remark
that, while there is no doubt that confirmatory as well as
concessional charters were granted by William the Conqueror ¹
to Whitby in Prior Serlo’s time—which, of course, assumes
previous grants and charters by one benefactor or more—there
is little reason to doubt that copy of at least one such charter,
conveying a grant to Prior Reinfrid, is extant I refer to the
charter by Hugh, Earl of Chester² (No, 25), which occurs on f. 7

¹ It must be remarked here that Young (Hinc. qs maiam, p. 253) doubts
the existence of any ehu-ter by the Conqueror =—“ Were we to suppose,
with Chai-lton, that the chartei· of King william, on the 47th leaf of the
Whitby Revister, is a charter- of the conqueror, then Serlo must have been
Prior before the year 1087. But that charter, compared with other
authentic documents, contains intrinsic evidence that it was obtained after
the possessions of the Monastery were far more considerable than they were
in the conqueror-’s reign, and that it must therefore have been given by
william Rufus.” But 1 think it will be seen as the inquiry proceeds that
Young had not duly examined the evidences which are available, and that it
is merely sn unsupported assumption on his part that the possessmns of the
Monastery were so inconsiderable in the conqueror-'s time.

² Here again, attention must be claimed for Young’s commentar-y on the
chartei· noted in the text. “ The anthenticity of this char-ter is partly con-
firmed by ⁴ Domesdsy,’ where we find that Flaneburg or Flambrough belonged
to Earl Hugh ; yet it must be observed that no mention is made of a church
there. Independent of this circumstance, the charter- is a little suspicions,
