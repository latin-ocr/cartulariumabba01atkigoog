INTRODUC'I'ORY OHAPTERs. xxi

and moreover, the desolation was merely that of the “ Holy
House ’' and its adjuncts. In point of fact, the “ Memorial of
Benefactions‚'' already once referred to, defines the conse-
quences of the ravages of the Danish host with very sufficing
precision, namely, thus :—“ Thenceforward, for two hundred
years and more, the holy service of the monks and pious nuns
was in that place discontinued.”¹

I am quite aware that such views on this subject are likely
to be regarded as quite heretical. Dr. Young, in so many wordS,
states not only that “ when the Abbey was ruined by the Β61166,
1116 town of Streoneshalh shared the same fate,’' which is, 1
suppose, fairly certain 3 but als0, that “ when, after the lapse of
two hundred years, the monastery was restored, the town
revived als0.” And a more recent writer takes precisely the
same view, inasmuch as in his little book about Whitby and its
Vicinity, we find him distinctly stating that while “ the town
of Streoneshalh and its monastery were destroyed by the Danes
in 867, both lay desolate for two hundred years ;’' and again,
and repeatedly‚ that when the town did revive, it “ arose, like
its predecessor, Streoneshalh, as a dependency on the Abbey.”

It is difficult to understand how such views as these, incon-
sistent alike with common sense, reason and experience, and
contradictory to historical facts and inferences patent to the
most superficial student, could ever have obtained credit or
currency, or indeed have found admission into an “ historian's ”
mind.

For we find ourselves, the moment our attention is turned to
the matter, face to face with a numerous, and, we cannot doubt,
important colony of Danes and N orthmen. For, passing by,
for the present, the Domesday entry touching Whitby and its
dependencies, the following is the corresponding list of place-
names afforded by the “ Memorial of Benefactions,'’—“ Witebi,
Overbi et N ethrebi, Thingwala, Leirpel, Helredale, Gnip, Nor-
manebi, Fielinga et alia F ielinga, Bertwait, Setwait, Snetune,
Hugelbardebi, Sourebi‚ Risewarp, N enham, Stachesbi‚ Baldebi‚
Breccha‚ Flore, Dunesleia,”—every one of them, twenty-one in
number, save only Neuham and Dunesleia, demonstrably of
Danish origin and imposition. “ In other words, Streoneshalch
and its environing district had, long before the Norman Conquest,
