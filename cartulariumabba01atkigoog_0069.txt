said lands is specified, and by which it is formally conveyed, is
a charter of the Conqueror’s‚ and not of his son William’s ; and
second, that the charter of the latter—proved his beyond ques-
tion by the specified grant of the church of All Saints in
F ishergate—-deals with the aforesaid lands as already in the
possession of the monastery in virtue of a former grant by
another than himself—“ de terris quas de dominio meo possid-
ent,'' being the terms employed. The fact that remainS, then,
is that the lands in Hackness and N ordfeld, alleged by the
unknown writer whose statements are under examination to
have been granted by Rufus, at Prior Serlo's petition, to him and
his monastery, were, not so granted by him, but had been given
by his father in the interval between the date of the Domes-
day inquiry and that of his death. And this being so, the
doubts as to the accuracy and trustworthiness of this unknown
writer, suggested by his statements made in reference to
Radulfus de Everley, are still further progvoked, and greatly
augmented‚ by this det-ection of a direct historical misstate-
ment—possibly unintentional as it may really have been.

But there is yet another historical misstatement involved in
’ the same narrative which still further diminishes any confi-
dence we might even wish to feel in the writer in question.
Hackness was not only not “ in feudo Domini RegiS‚'’ but was
in reality in that of William de Pemy, at a distance from whom
and whose territory the petitioner for these lands is represented
as wishing to remove himself and his monastery3 a circum-
stance which inevitably discredits either the writer's honesty
or his qualification as a trustworthy historian.

We have still the statements touching the desire manifested
by William de Percy to take from his brother all the lands and
vills he had hitherto bestowed on the monastery to inquire
into; but before doing s0, there are other matters which it will
be better to pass in review and consider—matters which depend
on an entry in Domesday of such a nature as to introduce
new perplexities It is this :—speaking of Whitby with its
sokes, these latter amounting in all to twenty-eight carucates
liable to Danegeld‚ the compiler says—“ Haec habet HugO, et
Willelmus de Perci de eo, Peene omnia wasta. Tantummodo
