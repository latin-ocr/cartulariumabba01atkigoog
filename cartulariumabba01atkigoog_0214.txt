¹ Iu the Memorial (p. 3), where there ia a correspondiug liat to this iu
the present document, we find “Ne’Srebi id est Steinsecher;'' here Staiu-
eecher is separated from Niderbi, and, without doubt, wrongly 80. In the
same way, what in the Memorial is “ Gnip, id eat Hauehesgard,'’ is in this
deed resolved into two separate places. The identification of the Memorial
may surely be taken in both instances. Stainaacre then, at the present time,
represents Netherby or Niderbi.

² Charlton, without comment, gives High Whitby as the site of Overby.

⁸ Thingwala in the Memorial. One of the most remarkable, if not
actually the most remarkable, of all the words or names in the Chartulary.
It remained for the editor of the present volume to be the first to call atten-
tion to it. In the Glooeary os the Cleveland Dialect, Introd. p. 12, note, he
writes—‘⁶ This name is eo marked that it is difficult to conceive it should
never have attracted attention from any local historian or antiquary before.
‘ Tingwall, hvor, som navnet (binga v'dllr) autyder, &erues Hovedthing
gjennem Aarhundreder blev holdt‚’ as Worsaae says of the famous Thingwal
of Shetland, are words fully as expressive, beyond doubt, and as capable of
application in the case of the Whitby Thingwala, aa in Cheeter, Orkney, Roas-
ehire, or Shetland iteelf. It was, as surely as in these other casea, the
hovedtlainy, or principal political and judicial meeting-place for the district ;
and it speaks very intelligibly of the extent to which the district was not
only under the influence of, but inhabited by, men of N orthern or Danish
origin, that such a place of meeting should have existed in Cleveland.''

⁴ Larpool.

⁵ ‘⁴ This is that dale through which a nameless beck runs, which empties
itself into the Esk at Spital Bridge.''—- (Chariton, p. 69, note.) See mention
made of it in Nn. 572.

⁶ M. Bertuait. The nite unknown. Setwait is mentioned next in order
iu the Memorial, but ie omitted here. Α

⁷ M. and A. both read Bilrod ς Bilroche elsewhere: now Billery.

⁸ According to Charlton, identical with Sneaton-Thorp.

⁹ Baldbyfields 3 known by that name till lately, if not still ς lying on the
slope on the right hand aa one leaves the Station by train.

¹⁰ Uncertain. Char-lton says, “ probably Crosa-Buttess' Brec in M.

¹¹ Stereotyped in Flowergate.
