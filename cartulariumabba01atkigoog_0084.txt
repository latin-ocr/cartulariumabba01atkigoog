carry out, his plans for the erection of an Abbacy in place of
the hitherto existing Priorate.

As to the time when this change was finally carried out,
although there are no precise dates available to us, still Ι think
there are facts and considerations such that a safe inference
may be founded upon them3 and also perhaps a further infer-
ence as to a part, at least, of the considerations by which the
Royal consent to such a change was induced.

In a note on a previous page it was observed that it
seemed much more than simply apparent that there were at
least two periods at which donatione to the rising Abbey
were made by the Founder‚—-—the first on or about the date of
Reinfrid's arrival and commenced work at Whitby, which may
without violence be held to include the much more than only
possible augmentations conceded on occasion of his brother's
admission into the number of the monks; the second, that
which is marked by the still extant chartei· in which his wife,
his heir, and two other sons are named as “ concessores''
together with himself, as well as acting as witnesses to his
grant. That this charter was granted after the commencement
of the reign of the second William, is patent from the fact that
he is named in it as reigning at the time ; but at what particular
period in that reign there is nothing in the charter itself posi-
tively to indicate. Nevertheless, it would almost seem possible
to infer the probable date, at least approximately, from some
consideratione, suggested partly by historical fact, and partly by
the wording of the charter. The Founder, it is known—at
least the statement to that effect is not disputed—took part in
the Crusade of 10963 and, according to the Memorialist, died
on the march to Jerusalem at a place called “ Mons Gaudium,”
within what he calls “ the province of J erusalem.'' This would
be, of course, after the rendezvous at Constantinople in 1097,
but how long after there is no means of knowing, nor is it
material. What there is that it is to our purpose to remark is,
that William de Perci’s last and enlarged grant must have been
made before he set out to join the crusading host, and most
likely before he began to make his final preparatione for so
sormidable an expedition. Indeed, no more plausible suggestion
can well be made than that the resolution to take part in the
crusade‚ and the resolution to erect an Abbey at Whitby in
