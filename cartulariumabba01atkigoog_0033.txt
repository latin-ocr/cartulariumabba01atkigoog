INTRODUOTORY CHAPTERS. xxix

said3 from William de Perci‚ and from divers others, members
of the family of Perci‚ or connectione of it by marriage, or sub-
feudatories; and no less from a host of others in no way related
or connected with the family of the founder and patron, who
follow one another in rapid succession until at last, in Abbot
Roger’s time (1222-44), the summit of wealth and prosperity
seems to have been reached.

A moment's pause here to note the fact that the port was
given by william de Perci, the founder, to the Abbey in Prior
Serlo’s time, and to remark—and I think there is ground for
calling attention to the fact after what we have above had
occasion to notice in connection with the money, and therefore
with the mercantile, importance of the port—that this was,
there can be no doubt at all, as weighty a part as any of the
whole grant, at least potentially and in the future, if not
actually and at the time then present. It should be noted 100,
that, what with Earl Hugh's grant and William de Perci’s, no
small part of what was afterwards known as “ Whitby Strand,'’
and accurately defined by well-known meres and boundaries‚
had already, before the year 1100, become the property of the
Abbey. There would be no deficiency then, even at this early

period, of means for carrying on whatever works might be
considered desirable¹

¹ Perhaps 111010 distinct reference should be made to the fact, adverted to
in note 6, p. 93, 10 No. 108, that 00 early 00 Prior Serlo’s times there was
at Whitby an official whose style 0011 title was ‘⁴ Magister Operis ejusdem
loci‚'' 0011 to the inevitahle inference derivable from such 0 fact. Con-
0110011νο work of a systematic character was of necessity being pushed
formul, and under the guidance and 1111001100 of a competent or scientific
designer and snrveyor. This may also be the place for calling attention to
one noteworthy fact connected with the existing remains oi the Abbey
Church. That buildings of early Norman date once existed, there 000 be no
question ; but the questions what were they, where were they, what became
of them, are questions which may be asked—-perhaps must be asked—but
cannot be answered. Indeed, no attempt at answering them can now be
010110. What may be regarded 00 0 10010 legend 10110 of 0 chapter-house as
existing in early Norman times, but there is no tangible traco either of it or
any other structure of the same style. The east end of the existing ruined

earlier date than the former half of Abbot Roger's incumbency, and it 10 10
