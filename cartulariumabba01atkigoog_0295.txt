CCXLVIII. CARTA Evsmm ns Ros ns DUABUS onmem-13
TERRA m BRm1GESTONA.⁵

(63¹³) Everardus de Ros, Roberto fratri suo}³ et omnibus paren-

¹ M. Dulicildehalc. In A. the name looks rather like Dulicildehal03 but
there csn be little doubt that the letter is n sud not li.

² Μ. Scortebuttes.

⁸ The witnesses’ names sre all in the nominative. Son of Alsn de Perey
and grandson of william Asgernons.

⁴ M. Bradelay. No other witnesses.

³ These are necessarily the two carucatas in Briningeston (or Burniston)
given to the renascent monastery by King william, sud repeatedly con·
firmed by his successore, sud which, of equal necessity, had been granted in
fee to the author of this deed at a very early period, inssmuch as the present
deed of release must date as fer back as 1150·1160, or thereabouts, at the
latest, the names of the witnesses being a sufficient attestation to that fact„

⁶ Dugdale throws no light upon the identity of the grantor. He speaks
of Peter, “ the ancestor of the grest- and noble family ’² of Ros or Roos of
Hamlake, and of his benefaction to St. Mary’s Abbey at York, his marriage,
etc„ and then proceeds to his son Robert, who, as he states, in 3 Henry 11.
(1152), gave to the King 1000 marks for livery of the lande of Walter
Espee, of his mother Adeline‘s inheritsnce. Nming Robert de Ros' wife,
Sibylla de valoines, he simply says he left by her s son and heir, Evemd,
who was a minor at his father‘s death, and s ward of Rsnulph de Glanvill in
12 Henry 11. He held of the Κίος eight knights' sees and a half, sud in
22 Hem-y 11. paid a fine of 5:526 sor his lande, etc. This, of course, throws
him much too late to admit of identification with the present grsntor. The
most probable assumption is that, besides Robert‚ Peter had another son,
Evertit-d, and that the Eversrd and Robert of the present deed are the said
two sons. The probable, or rather approximate, date of the deod, so far
from being inconsistent with such a theory, lends much probability to it.
