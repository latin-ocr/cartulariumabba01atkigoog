with the vills of “ Nordfeld, Sudfeld, et Everlaye‚ Brocesaye et
Torenlaye‚'' precisely as in his father's charter, and without the
slightest hint or reference to intimate that there had been any
alienation‚ or was now any restitution, of the vill of Everley.
In fact, there can be no reasonable doubt that, just as this
same Abbot William granted to Ascatil or Ascatin‚ son of
William de N ewham‚ the vills of Haukesgarth and N ormanby
in exchange for Newham, hitherto held of the Abbey by his said
father, and he from that time forth was called Ascatin de
Haukesgarth. So Everlaye was held of the Abbey by Radul-
phuS, the grant having been made to him not long after the
acquisition‚ in virtue of the grant which was formally confirmed
in the charter of William de Percy just now quoted.

ΙΙ. To turn next to some consideration of matters connected Considera-
with the statements touching the place called Hachanes‚ {3¹22ssssssss
Hachan08‚ or HackneSS. I suppose the first distinet mention difflm‘litffi
of t-his place in relation with Whitby is that made by Bede in ξῖιιξιιῖζαξῖι-
his Historia Ecclesiastica. After having mentioned the death {5233 the
of Hild (which took place November 17, 680), he goes on to ‘32:¹0ssss
mention an incident alleged to have taken place, coincideutly ι ”
with her death, in the monastery at Hacanos, which monastery
Hild had herself established in the course of that very year.l
This monastery or cell was destroyed by the Danes in 869, but
it is remarkable that no sooner is the work of restoration heard
of at Whitby‚ than we hear also of coincident connection of
Hackness with the reviving monastery. In the Memorial‚
Reinfrid is stated to have been buried in the cemetery of St.

Peter at Hachanos‚ at the middle point of the east end of the
church ; and a little below, among the early gifts to Whitby‚
occurs the significant mention of “the church of St. Peter at
Hachanessc‚ where our monks served God, died, and were
buried.''² And it is further to be observed that in the charter

by william the Conqueror, to which Lanfranc, Bishop Osmund

²⁸ The entire passage is :—“ Villam de Hachanesse et duo molendina, et
eeclesiam S. Mariae ejusdem villae, et ecclesiam S. Petri, ubi monachi nostri
Deo servierunt, obierunt, et sepulti sunt.'' The language clearly implies a
monastic settlement at St. Petet-’Q which had already been one of continuity,
early as the date oi the Memor-iai certainly is.
