appellabatur, nunc autem Witebi vocatur, Willelmus de Perci,
cognomento Lesgernuns, tempore Wiuelmi Bastard (nothi) Regis
Anglorum ibi fundaverit Monasterium in honore Sancti Petri
Apostoli et S. Hyldae Abbatissae, atque Reinfrido monacho de
Evesham cum sociis suiS, quos sibi adquisiverat, ipsum locum
commendaverit, et primo duas carucatas terrae in Prestebi illi
tradidit.”

Dr. Young, while remarking on one page ¹ that ‘⁴ the
lands at Whitby,'' namely “ the six carucates at Presteby and
Soureby in the manor of Whitby,’' ‘⁴ were scarcely considered
as church property, being held by the Abbot Stephen as a
vassal or tenant under the lord of that manor,” at another²
makes “ no doubt ’' that these “ lands of Presteby and
Soureby in Whitby manor are the same which William de
Percy gave to Reinfrid and his fraternity,'’ and more ex-
plicitly still, in a third place,3 adds, “ The lands of Prestebi,
consisting of two carucatas, are obviously the same which
William de Percy first gave to Reinfrid and his fraternity, as
stated in the Memoria13 and unto these had been added the
lands of Sourebi (supposed to be Sneaton-Thorp), consisting of
four carucates.’' He omits, however, to notice the discrepancy
between the statement of his authority, the Memorialist, as to
the nature of the gift to Reinfrid—“ in elemosinam perpetuam ’'
-and that of the tenure by the Abbot of York previously
noted by him. It would appear to me that the gift in free
alms to Reinfrid, and the grant in ordinary tenancy to the
Abbot of York, must be two distinct matters, and that the
lands concerned in either, at least most probably, must be as
distinct as the gift and grant themselves. That there was a
gift to Reinfrid there can be no doubt whatever, and, admitting
that gift, it must, in order to its validity, have been confirmed
by the tenant in capite, or Hugh of Chester; and yet further,
admitting the authenticity of the said Earl's charter to Reinsrid
-and for doing so we have seen not simply weighty, but I
think conclusive, reasons—then we must also admit not only
the grant of the church of St. Peter but also of “ omnia quae ad
eam pertinent,'' and it will be hard, in the face of all the pre-
ceding considerationS, to limit the meaning of this phrase so as
