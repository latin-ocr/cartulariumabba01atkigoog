become the seat of a number of separate and independent
Danish settlements—-a fact which, while it testifies, on the one
hand, to the eligibih'ty and material wealthiness of the district
surrounding and including the monastery itself, tells us also,
on the other, that the same active, enterprising, energetic spirit
which wrung far more than a mere scanty subsistence from the
difficult soil and inhospitable climate of Iceland, was little
likely to let the fair and fertile slopes of Fieliug, Gnipe, Nor-
manby, Prestebi, Netherbi, Overbi‚¹ Dunsleia, N ewham, Sueton‚
and the rest, be uncompelled by the labours of the agriculturist,
or the harbour and mart of Whitby remain unfrequented by
the keel of the merchantman, the boats of the hardy fisherS,
and the thick-coming visits of chapmeu from more distant
havens as well as the nearer.'’

In this connection I wish to draw especial attention to the
great fact involved in the name which stands fourth in the
list of Whitby place-names given a few lines above-I mean
Thingwala.

It seems to have been reserved for me even to notice, and
much more to direct attention to, this very noteworthy and
significant name.² For there can be no more question of what
it was, and meant, than in the case of the Cheshire Thingwall‚
the Shetland Tingwall or Dingwall, or even the Icelandic
Thingvalla itself. As Worsaae says of the former, our Whitby
Thingwala ‘⁴ affords a very remarkable memorial of the Court
—or Thing—which the N orthmen settlers were accustorned to
hold in close connection with their sacred offerings to their
gods.'’ Its site, however, is now uncertain. All we know is
that it existed, and that down to the beginning of the thirteenth
century certainly, and probably very much later, it was identi-
fiable.

But to us the significance of the name and of the fact is not
the least lessened by the difficulty, or worse, of identifying the
site. The Old English “ marks,” “ tythiugs,'’ “ hundredS,‘’
‘⁴ frithborh8,” had all been swept away—save only the name of

¹ 1 casually ascet-taine& two or three years ago, that the rent of a farm oi
140 acres in what is no doubt the district embraced by Overbi and Netherbi,
and not far from Gnipe (now Hawsker), was not less tban ..⁴:380 a year.
