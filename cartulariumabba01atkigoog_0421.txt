afterwards (p. 243) :—“ Among all the particulata contained in the aforegoing
articles, nothing to me appears so extraordinary as the building a gold-mill
in that desert place where Rigg-miu now stands, the use and design of which
it is difficult for us to understand. Whether some doting monk‚ pretending
to more knowledge than the rest of mankind, deluded Sir Alexander with a
notion that he had found out the philosopher-'s stone, and understood the
art of extracting gold from some particular metal or minera13 or whether
this mill was intended for the making of leaf-gold, an invention that had
been discover& only about forty years before, Ι leave the curious to judge:
—Bnt whatever was their intention, the scheme, it seems, miscarried‚ and a
great deal of money was wanted, little to the profit or advantage of Sir
Alexander.” The last sentence is peculim-ly characteristic of the author, as
is also the note appended., there being precisely the same amount of founda-
tion for the one as for the other. The note is-—“ There is a particular kind
of grey stone found in some parts of our mcor, which, being fluxed, a kind
of yellow metal‚ very much resembling gold, is extr-acted therefrom ; and
possibly some curious monk, who was not altogether unacquainted with
Alchytny, after making this discovery, might think he could transmute
this metal into real gold.” The date of the book is 1779, and it is marvel-
lous that an author living then, a shrewd man of business and of consider-
able intelligence‚ should bring himself to believe in the grey stone, in the
unnamed “kind of yellow metal, very much resembling gold‚” extracted
from it, and found the whole romanoe on no more substantial foundation
than his own marvellous blunder between the Latin words for a wind-
mill and a gold-mill. ¹ auhmamenta.

² The construction here is altogether defective. Probably by reading
accipiant for accipientes the necessary emendation would be made.
