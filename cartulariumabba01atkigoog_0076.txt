verisimilitude. For naturally, on our threefold assumption,
the idea of accession to the Priorate on Reinfrid's death would
suggest itself, most probably to Stephen himself, or if not to
Stephen himself, yet certainly to such of the fraternity as were
more particularly attached to him.1 And, at least as naturally,
there being such a person as Serlo de Percy, a brother of the
actual refounder of the reviving House of Whitby, able and
willing to become Prior in Reinfrid's place, the appointment
would surely fall upon him. There would in this be a prolific
source of dissatisfaction and discontent to Stephen and his
party3 and such dissatisfaction might naturally, perhaps of
necessity, lead in such unsettled times to the secession of suc-h
party in a body, and its withdrawal towards and ultimate
settlement at York.2

Assuming that there was such a secession as this, headed

¹ In point of fact this is the idea which, in some one or other of Stephen's
personal admirer-s or adherents, led to the framing of the legend of the
supersession of Reinfrid by Stephon at the very commencement of the
monastic career of the latter.

² It is necessary to speak with some degree of reservo, inasmuch as while
the alleged Stephen narrative states that Stephen and his monks removed
from Whitby to Lastingham‚—“ ibi saltem manere cupientes,''—and were
thence, within no long time, translated to York, there to lay, at the cburch
of St. Olave, the essential foundation of what afterwards became the great
Abbey of St. Mary of York, Domesday lends some sort of importance, if not
confirmation, to the statement in question3 for we find that in the vicinity
of Lastingham the Abbot of York held, and under precisely the same con-
ditions as under William de Perci at Whitby, several ‘⁴ maneria, ” with their
appurtenances, under Berengarius de Todeni 3 but at Lastingbam itself, only
1 villan with l plough. The full entries touching the Abbot's foe in this
