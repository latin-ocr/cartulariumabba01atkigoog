them they are not consistent with either reason or probability ;ι
and inasmuch as they are inconsistent with the statements of
other writers whose accuracy and acquaintance with the facts
eoncerned‚ apart from the narrative itself, there is no reason to
suspect, there can be little hesitation in rejecting them as
incredible, perhaps even in discrediting them as fictions, if not

falsehoods²²
On the whole, then, we assume the material truth and

accuracy of the statements of the Whitby Memorialist touohing
Reinfrid, his primate, its unbroken continuity, his death as
recorded, and, what should not be omitted, his burial at Hack—
ness; and, continuing to pay attention to the said narrative,
we are informed that, after Prior Reinfrid’s death, Ser10, the
brother of William de Perci, was invested with the vacant
office, and remained in it until their nephew, William de Perci,

was created Abbot.⁸ And it is also noticed that the creation
in question took place at some undefined time before William
de Perci went to the Holy Land.

Dr. Young, in speaking of the events here recorded, simply
says, “ Serlo was succeeded by his nepheW‚ William de Pemy,
who obtained the title of Abbot,'’ having at a previous page

¹ It may be remarked that the same character appel-taine to several of the
statements made in that part of the narrative which bears immediate refer-
ence to the proceedings connected with the foundation and endowments of
St. Mary’s Abbey at York. There is much of inconsistency and improba-
bility involved, which this, however, is not the place to expose.

² The view I am inclined to take οἱ this composition is perhaps indicated
in the terma employed in describing it in the text, as that of “ the alleqed
Stephen.” In other words, 1 do not feel inclined to look upon it in its
existing form as emanating from Stephen at all, or as originating in Stephen’s
time, or indeed at any period very near his time. On the contrary, it looks
much more like the productiori of some admirer of Stephen, whose object it
was to add distinction to his name, and who, with some amount of real
knowledge—whether derived from tradition or from written sources—drew
upon his imagination als0, and was besides not too careful to avoid local
and other inaccuracies and inconsistencies. Regarded, therefore, as in con-

nection with Stephen as its author, Ι look upon it as a forgery.
