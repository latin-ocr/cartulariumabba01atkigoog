GARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 327

hiis casibus liberi non erunt, sed theloneum sicut alii de pro·
vincia persolvent. Cum autem de animalibus hominum de
Sneton in dicta villa de Sneton venditis fieri postulassent, huic
dictus Abbas non adquievit.

SEXTUS ARTIGULUS. Petiitque idem Alexander, pro se et ho-
minibus suis, quod filicem in partibus de Yburn, et in ejus latere,
metere possent absque invadiatione, quod quidem nec fuit
vetitum nec concessum eis, sed secundum quod se gererent
patiendos,¹ utpote, si bene paterentur, sin alias, aliter.

SEPTIMUS ARTmULUS. Petit idem Alexander fidelitatem sive
servitium debitum ab Abbate pro quibusdam terris in campo
de Sneton 2—[cum vero responderemus nos] 2 nullae terras de
collatione antecessorum suorum nisi puratas et quietas conse-
cutos, non credenti scripta nostra protulimus. Ipsi autem
super aliqua particula haesitantes, ut monumenta quaerentes et
inventa exhibentes, taliter satisfacelemus⁸—quod quidem difficile
erat tam cito monumenta singula invenire, usque alias dilatum
est.

OCTAVUS ART1cULUS. Cum semper forestarii nostri messona-
rium dicti Alexandri, sive nemorum suorum custodem, arcum et
sagittas deferre prohiberent, ipsas ac saepe auferenteS, aliquando
atthachiantes ipsum, non debere dici Forestarium sed Wod-
warde asserentes ;—tandem sic conquievit.

¹ The sense is apparent although the Latin is sufficiently halting. The
permission was to depend upon their good conduct ; if they behaved them·
selves they might have the brackens without fine z if otherwise, not.

² The words within the brackets have been marked ont with inlr and are
nearly undecipherable. The deleting ink is of a peculiar tint, and it is by
no means apparent either when or why such deletion was attempted.

³ This entire sentence again is so corrupt that emendation is very difficult-
Hoess'tants', however, instead of hesitantes, to agree with ipsi and governed by
satisfaceremus, seems fairly obvious, and taking ut as substituted ior cum, the
sense probably intended may be extracted. Charlton’ s rendering is—‘ ‘To
which it was answered, that we had received no landa from the liberality of
his ancestors but what vere free and clear from every service. On their
not allowing this we produced our char-tera, but they, scrupling some
particulare, and finding fault with these records as the inventions of our
own braine, we gave them for answer that every single record was not so
easily to be met with, so this matter vas postponed to another time ;” the
note being—‘⁸ Probably the Abbot's book was shewed to Sir Alexander, in
which copies of all their Chai-tera were contained ”—a sur-mise as far wide
of the truth as any of those which precede it.
