66 CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

Ecclesiae S. Petri et S. Hyldae de Wytebi (17¹³) illas duas bovatas

the next chartei· Roget· de Argentom, the grantor, speaks of his father ss
Roget· fitzPeter. and not as william fitzRobert, as, according to the memo-
randum, he must have been. Consequently the Roger of No. 72 must be a
member of another branch oi the family. In N ο. 217 ο, Roger de Argentom
quitclnims to the Abbey certain small portione of lund nt Uplium which he
thus describes 2—-“ illam terram quam Juliana, uxor Wiu. de Argentum,
nomine dotis de domo de Wyteby acquisivit illarum duarum bovatamm
quas will. de Argentom, maritus ejusdem J ulianae, dedit Deo et Eccl. de
Wyteby.'’ This William is of course the william fitzRobert of the present
chat-ter, end the Roget who grsnts the ssid No. 217 could hardly speek of
him as he does if any very near relationship existed. It may be open to
question, however, whether the Roget· de Argentom of the charter immedi-
ately preceding N ο. 217 is identicsl with the Roger of the latter, or the son
of william fitzRobert. Among the witnesses to Ne. 217 are Gregor. de
Argentine and Joh. de Argentine, the former being also a witness to No. 72.
In the Gysburne Cartulsry (Gott. uss, Cleop. D. ii.)‚ ff. 326¹² and 327, a Greg. de
Argentum, distinguished as de Ketton, ia mentioned in three consecutive char·
tera, having two daughters, Amicis and Agnes, his co-heiresses‚ owning pro·
perty in Ugthorp; and, again, in three other chartei-s on f. 3221), ει Greg. de
Argentom is named owning property in Ugthorp, who describes himself as a
nephew of a Richnrd de Algentem, but his father-'s name is not mentioned. His
wife's nsme was J uliann. But it is not possible to identify the one Gregory
with the other; indeed it is more probable they are father and son. There
is, besides, on f. 333 οἱ the eme us. a series of charters by Willinm de
Argentom of such a nature as in part to discredit No. 425. In the lstter
Roget· de Argentum, son of william, son of Robert, is stated to have left
three daughters, co·heiresses‚—Agnes, Asmota, and Elizsbeth,-—the second
of whom, Asmota, was espoused to Albert de Crawcestre,—“ de quibus
exierunt Yvo et J acobus qui obierunt sine prole.” However, in the third of
the chsrters just referred to, Will. de Argentom makes known “ omn. homi-
nibus suis et amicis, Francigenis et Anglicis . . . me d. et c. et conf. Alberto
de Crawcestris cum sorore mea Christisnn,'’ five scot-e acres of land in Red-
ker 3 and it is further certain from other documents in the same Cartulsry
that there were two sons issue to this marriage, Yvo, called both de Ornw·
cester end de Redker, but the latter most frequently and prevailingly in the
end, and william. The latter died ep„ but Yvo had issue Jacobus, who
also appears to have died childless. Besides the above chellenge of Albert
de Crawcestre’s wife Christiana. ss his sister by william de Argentom,
Albert’s son Yvo is distinctly styled his nepheW. The memorandum is
therefore undoubtedly wrong ss to the name Asmots, and csn only be right
as to the person on the supposition that the three co-heiresses he mentions
became so on the death, without issue, of their brother william. But the
entire question of the mutual relstiomhip of these Argentoms, and oi their
connection with the more famous and somewhnt later family, of which Sir
Giles was so conspicuous a member, is utterly obscure. It is not quite wide
