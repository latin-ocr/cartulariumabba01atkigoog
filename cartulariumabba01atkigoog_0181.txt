Robert de Pothow, and others of like date, are co-witnesses with Robert de
Stutevill. What the relationship, however, between the said Robert de
stuteville and the William de Stuteville of No. 73, may have been, though
nowhere hinted at in the present series of documenta, is apparently a matter
of tolerably direct inference. According to Dugdale, Robert de Stuteville 1.
was living in 1080 and 1107 3 his son, Robert de Stuteville 11., was at the
battle oi the Standard in 1138, was assessed to an aid for marrying the
King's daughter in 1166, was Sheriff of Yorkshire 1170-1175, and was still
living in 1177, ii not, inferentially‚ ior some time after that. Robert 111„
son of Robert 11., is merely mentioned, without any dates, 88 8 benefactor oi
Rievaulx ; but 1118 8011 William is named as taking an active part in public
matters as early 88 1172, and as dying in 1294. Passing by the various
difficulties and perplexities involved in this statement, and especially as col-
lated with the statements made 111 reference to these same noblemen by
Orderic vitalis, as not 01 great (if any) interest to the present inqniry, and
merely hinting in relation to them that it is more thau probable that in
more than one oi the references the second and third Roberts are confounded
together, it remains to be noticed that the William de Stuteville last men-
tioned as dying in 1204—a date which tallies well enough with that
necessarily given to No. 73‚—a direct 1111081 descendant, moreover, 01 1110
Robert de Stutevill'named by Graves as grantor of Ayton, had two 80118,
Robert and Nicholas, by his wife Berta, niece of Ranulph de Glanville. Of
these, Robert died ap„ leaving his brother N icholas his heir. This Robert
appears certainly to be the witness to the present deed, and the others
already noted as attested by him and Roger de Bosco. Moreovcr, it was
through J ohanna, the granddaughter 01 Ν10110188 just named, that 1110 Ayton
property passed into the Wake family.

¹ The additional witnesses, as given in No. 348, are Reginald de Roselle,
Radulphus de Nevylle, Willelmus de Mauteby (Maltby), willelmus de
Tocota Rogerus Persona de Semar, Thomas Capelianus, Walter' de Hoton,
and Walter’ de Morton.

² The dedication of Goathland Church is to S. Mary, and the probability “

18 that the “ Eremitorium” oi the Fratres endowed by Henry 1. (N o. 195),
and who eventually commended themselves to Whitby with that king’s
sanction, in order to become a cell of the Abbey 01 like order and habit, was
closely connected with the ancient parochial church. This deed must pro·
bably precede the commending of the Eremitorinm to Whitby.
