its nature and its probable acerbity—which would certainly
not be diminished by the recollection that he and his Monas·
tery had become so far important and influential—must all be
admitted ; in the former, when we take into considerat-ion the
strangely loose and inaccurate way—not to say the reckless
and mythical, or the intentionally incorrect and mendacious
way—in which the writers of such narratives as that of the
alleged Stephen and of the Dodsworth memoranda, and even
some of the later monastic scribeS,1 put their so-called history
together, there is no difficulty in accounting for such tales as
those which convey to us all the information we possess as to
variance between Serlo and his brother, and particularly as to
the desire and attempt of the latter to take back all his former
gifts to the Monastery. On the whole, I entertain little doubt
that William de Perci did, for some reason or other, prees, or
perhaps force, upon his brother the resignation of the headship
of the Whitby Monastery3 and that the pressure so applied
was applied at the time he had made, and been enabled to

¹ 1 refer especially to the “Memorandum'' (N ο. 376) printed below
(p. 312), which occurs on f. 129 of the Strickland MS„ and which would
be very valuable in elucidating our present part of the early history oi the
Abbey if we could depend on its statements. But when we find such alle·
gations deliberately put toward, and in the very teeth of charter after
chartei· and one Royal confirmation after another, that Alan, son of william
de Percy the founder, died without heir3 that the Percy inheritance on his
death descended to his brother Richard-Richard de Percy de Dunsley, οἱ
course—and to his son William after him ; and that the said Richard ‘⁴ nichil
dedit nec confirmavit‚’' it is impossible to attach any real credit to what
may be said in other parts of the same document as to matters about which
certain historical knowledge must have been, at all events, much more diffi-
cult to ari-ive at, and indeed not to be arrived at at all except by diligent
study and comparison of the very documents this scribe either never knew
of as existing‚ or never consulted if he was acquainted with them, or
deliberately put on one side as not worth the trouble of examination. Still,
notwithstanding this, for my own part 1 fully believe that this writer is
mainly correct in the statements he makes as to the extent and the bound-
aries of the lands which he says were given by William de Percy to God,
St. Peter and St. Hilda of Whitby, and to his brother Serlo; aud Ι have
sought as far as Ι could to make the view in question good by independent
reasoning. But, on the grounds above stated, 1 have not chosen to appeal
for support to the direct statements in point which this writer makes, when
his trustworthiness is assailed by such reckless misstatements as those
exposed in this note.
