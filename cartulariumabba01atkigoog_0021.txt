INTRODUCTORY CHA PTERS. xvii

early church thus presupposed, and of its connected buildingS,
are an concealed in utter obscurity. Probably it was origi-
nally a rude, rather than merely a plain, structure; very likely,
in the first instance, framed of split trunks of trees adjusted
side by side so as to give a partially smooth surface within,
with thatch of straw or rushes, and side-lights only partially
secured by slight lattice-work of split wood. And, no doubt,
t-he dwellings for the abbess, her nuns, and the servants of the
house, would be in accordance with the early rudeness of the
church itself, not better but rather worse, or more rude and
inartistic.

Still it must be borne in mind that the place was neither
> unknown nor unnamed. Although discerding, as utterly without
support, Young's ideas that “ there cannot be a doubt Whitby
was a place of some importance under the Roman Government ”
(conceding, however, that “ their ooasting vessels may have fre-
quented the harbour”), and that Dunsley Bay is the Dunum
Sinus of Ptolemy1—for the scaroity of Roman relics at Whitby‚
in common with the rest of Cleveland‚ is so marked as to call
for special regard,—I hold it to be a reasonable supposition
that the seafaring folk who occupied the district subsequently
to the departure of the Romans from Britain (even if not for
some considerable time before) would not be slow to note, and
to improve, the natural advantages presented by the harbour
as well as the soil. In other words, Ι cannot but think that
Streoneshalch, when Hilda availed herself of Oswiu’s pious
donation, was already a place not only of some importance, but
one in which what in these modern days is implied by the
word “ progress '’ was certainly by no means unknown. And
from other considerations I think it was, as elsewhere remarked,
already a place of some celebrity. For, although after the dis-
astrous battle of Haethfelt‚ in which King AEdwin lost his life,
the head of the slain monarch was taken to York, and eventu-
ally deposited in the Church of St, Peter, which he had himself

¹ 1 discat-d the sunniae as to the Dunum Sinus as incon-eet. The first
portion of this name (Dunodeia) is clearly identical with the Dun in such
place names as Dunesdene, Dnnesford, Dunestal, Dunestone‚ Dunesbi, Dune-
ἴση), Duutune‚ all from Domesday‚ and there is little doubt that the name is
of Anglian or Old English imposition.
