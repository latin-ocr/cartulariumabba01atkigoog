xliv INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS.

of Sir C. Strickland's Ms„ and in which, with greeting to
Archbishop Thomas of York, William de Perci, and He[nry]
‘ Vicecomes Ebor.,’ he grants to Prior Renfrid the Ohurch of S.
Peter at Whitby, with all ite appurtenances, and to that same
church, the Church of Fleinesburg also, “ cum omnibus decimis
Francigenis et Anglicis ;'’ the witnesses being Earl Alan (of
Bretagne), Ralph Paganel, Aschetil de Bulmer, Robert de Bruis,

and Gislebert fitzAdelard.

The mention of the church of Fleinesburg in this charter
is held to throw doubt on its authenticity. But there are
matters and considerations connected with or involved in the
charter itself of such a nature as necessarily to infer its essen-
tially genuine and authentic character. And in this connection
I ask attention first for the specified grant of tithes—“ cum
omnibus decimis Francigenis et Anglicis ”—accompanying that
of the church, and then to the fact that just such a grant was
assuredly made by Earl Hugh to Whitby, of a church with its
tithes‚ if not at Fleinesburg yet at Mideleshnrg, which specific
grant, however, seems to have missed any particular notice
at the hands os either Charlton or Young.¹ For the language

both because no notice is after-ward taken in our records of the Church of
Flamborough‚ . . . aud because the chat-ter in question has not been among
those that were first written in the Whaby Rem-ster, but has afterwards been
inserted in a different handwriting on a blank space that has been left at the
bottom of a page.’'—( Whitby, p. 252, n.) The consideration or objection
last named does not carry much weight with it: it is equally valid— or the
reverse—against every other similarly inserted charter' ιιι either of the two
copies in the Chartulary (or indeed' m an) other); and the number of such
inserted documents in either volume is very considerable, as surely was to
be expected when one remembers the way in which these transcripte were
made, and the avowed exclusion, at the time οἱ copying, of many documenta
in their proper places. The other objection is dealt with in the text.

¹ Charlton misreads and misconceives the important document noticed in
the next paragraph oi the text, and which ought to have arrested his special
attention; and misreads and misconceives it in more than one important
particular. Το specify but oue z—The conventio noted was made in settle·
ment of a disputa between the canons of Gyseburn and the monks of
Whitby‚ the former being the setters forth of the calumpnia or claim. The
two parties to it, therefore, must necessarily and of course be the said
monks of the one part, and the said canons of the other part. Notwith-
standing which sels-evident proposition, Charlton translates the clause
stating the settlement and agreement made, which is thus expressed in the
