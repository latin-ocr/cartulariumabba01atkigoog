been. But besides all this, which tends to make the alleged
Armiger a much younger man than the date of the assumed
grant to him would require-—to belong, in fact, to the genera-
tion next in succession—the language of the charters is hardly
consistent with any such grant. For we find William de Percy,
early in the reign of Ruina, conveying and confirming, among
many other large grants, “ N ordfeld‚ Sudfeld‚ Everlaye et Brok-
esaye et Tornelaye ;'' his wife Emma de Port, his sons Alan,
Walter and Richard, his kinsman Ernald de Percy (lord of the
Kildale and Ormesby maneria), the Archbishop Thomas, Fulco
Dapifer‚ Gilebert fitzAdelard (a witness to Earl Hugh's grant
already noticed) being among the witnesses Also, towards the
close of Rufus' reign, or at the very beginning of Henry’s, and
certainly between 1097 and 1101,1 we have a charter from Alan
de Percy confirming the vills of Filing, Haukesgarth and N or-
manby, which Abbot William had bought of Tanchardus Flan-

corresponding passage in the next preceding charter—that oi the Founderz

speaking of those already dead and those who are still living, but sor whom,
equally with those who are dead, the prayers of the Chureh are desii-ed. The
same is true in this first charter by Alan de Perci. Hugh, Earl of Chester, is
