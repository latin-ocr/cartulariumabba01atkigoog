On the whole, I read the history of the renascent Monastery
somewhat in this way. At or near the date alleged—some
definite but not very long time before 1078—-Reinfrid came to
Whitby‚ and before long succeeded in collecting a body os
would-be Religious, having already, it may be, ascertained the
willingnesS, or more than willingness, of William de Percy to
sanction his undertaking and to further his objects by leave and
licence to occupy the site of the ancient Monastery, if not by
a formal concession of the said site, its remains and appui-ten-
ances. But the concession, if it was not made at first, speedily
ensued, and a settlement, having at least more or less of regular

Reinfrid continued to act as superior of this monastic settle-

by a not insignificant party among the brethren, a suitable
successor to Reinfrid when the career of the latter was cut short
by his accidental death at Ormesbridge. The Percy family,
however, preferred that one of themselves should be promoted
to the vacant post, and probably in irritation or resentment at
this—possibly even under the impulsos of ambition-—Stephen
seceded from Whitby‚ and, making a temporary halt at Lesting-
ham, eventually, and indeed only a short time afterwards,
became Abbot of York, and perhaps as a sort of peace-offering
had a grant, as such, of certain territory at Whitby‚ which, how-

granted in free alms to Whitby‚ Sei-lo de Percy having become
