To Richard de Waterville, Peter, John de Evesham‚ and
Roger de Scardeburg succeeded‚ each in his turn. The last is
said to have spent some of his younger years in the cell at
Midlesburg. In his time, as already noted, the Abbey received
a great accession of territory and wealth, and reached the zenith
of its prosperity. And in his time, too, so far as the style of
the existing remains of the Abbey can testify‚ it seems probable
that the conventual church was put through a course of entire
reconstruction. The commencement of his rule may have well
seen the commencement of the eastern portion of the present
ruins, and the close of his reign—he died in 1244-cannot have
been very distant in point of time from the completion of the
third bay west of the centra] tower. But this is a subject too
wide to enter upon at the close of such a chapter in such a

volume as this.
