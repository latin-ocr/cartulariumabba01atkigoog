Prior in the room of Reinfrid. F urther concessions of property
were obtained for the Convent, just as some additions had
been made when he took upon himself the monkish profession,
and the renascent Monastery and its head became invested—
notwithstanding certain temporary checks sustained‚ at probably
an early period of Serlo’s presidency, under the attacks of one
or more bodies of marauders, which compelled a temporary
retreat to the Hackness Ceu-with considerable influence and
prestige. And it was when this was so that William de Perci
the Founder, animated by the same religious fervour which
sent him forth as a crussder to meet his fate in the Holy Land,
conceived the idea, in its practical form, of elevating what had
been hitherto merely a somewhat unimportant Priory into a
well-endowed and influential Abbey3 and his own grants and
donatione being largely supplemented by others from various
members of his family, and from a number of his “ homines ’'
or sub-infeudatorieS, the proposed change was effected, and
William de Percy, nephew of the F ounder and of Prior Ser10,
was advanced to be the first Abbot. It is quite possible that this
was brought about rather by the forcible supersession than in
virtue of the voluntary resignation of Prior Ser10, who, it is
certain, retired to the Cell at An Saints, York, and continued
to be Prior there for several years after the constitution of the
Abbey at Whitby. But whether he ceased to be Prior by
supersession or by resignation, a foundation might easily be
found in the fact of his ceasing to be Prior just when his
nephew was advanced to be Abbot for the stories compiled by
writers, living probably some generations afterwards, about the
variance between the brothers William and Ser10, and the perse-
cution the latter was supposed to have undergone at the hands
of his powerful, and, as alleged, unscrupulous brother,—a man
whose last recorded action is, notwithstanding, a munificent
deed of gift to the sels-same persecuted Prior and his monks.
As to the following list of the Superiors of the House of
Whitby‚ it should be observed that the dates of appointment
in the first column are those given by Burton,¹ and that it is
by no means clear in several cases whether they are the dates
of election, induction, or installation3 and that the dates of
