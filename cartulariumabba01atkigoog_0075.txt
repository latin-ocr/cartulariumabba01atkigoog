Thus the inconsistency between the statements of the alleged
Stephen narrative and that of Domesday is seen to be only the
more glaringly and hopelessly manifested, and it becomes more
than ever apparent how little of weight or credit such a story
can carry with it. And this is the more unfortunate because
it is entirely evident· that a connection of some kind did exist
or had existed between the early monastic settlers at Whitby,
or some of them, and that other monastic community which
eventually became the Abbot and Convent of St. Mary’s at
York.

For it is not only this perplexing entry in Domesday that
indicates such a connection3 there is the distinct statement by
Symeon of Durham that the monks of Whitby, after Reinfrid’s
death, migrated to York, and there set up—“ construxerunt ”—a
monastery to the honour of the Virgin Mary, which monastery,
at the date of the said Symeon’s History, was strenuously
administered by the Abbot Stephen. We have seen, as it
would seem, insuperable objections to the assertion that
Stephen superseded Reinfrid in the rule of the nascent Whitby
Community of Religious, as made in the narrative we have had
under examination. There is, however, no apparent reason for
supposing that he did not join the said community as it is
stated he did; and it is certain that in one way, if not in a
second—-and the probability is both in the one way and in the
other—he was a man of mark. I mean that he had become so
far distinguished as a monk, that his capacity and fitness to
become a ruler of monks, or of a monastic establishment, was
clearly manifested, whether or no——and clearly, I see no reason
to doubt that—-he was originally a man of worldly position and
influence. Whether we admit the account of his early intimacy
with Rufus, or that of his ability to obtain access to the
Conqueror's ear with his complaints and petitionS, or not, still
so much might be safely conceded. And granted his monastic
profession at Whitby, his there acquired and displayed fitness
for administering monastic discipline, and his more than
possible possession of mundane interest, it is possible, Ι think,
to frame a supposition or suggestion, founded on Symeon’s
distinct allegation concerning the migration to York on the
death of Reinfrid, which may really we'ar some amount oi
