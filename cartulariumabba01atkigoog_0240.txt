¹ In Ne. 458 we have a charter by Abbot Benedict, dated 1148, stating
at the eutset that ‘⁸ motu proprie, irrequisito censensu Capituli mei,” he has
instituted, that same year, a rector in the chapel ef Sueten, “ista conven-
tione ut quilibet rector ejusdem, qui pro tempore fuerit in posterum reddet
Ecclesiae S. Petri de Whiteby decem solides annuatim etc.” The document
then continues: “ Cer-pora vere defunctorum,'’ etc„ exactly as in the present
deed, te the end. That deed must, of course, have preceded this, and pro-
bably with ue great space ef time intervening. Possibly the presentatien
was made with some definite view as to the arrangement now made teuch-
ing the advewsen ef Sueten church er chapel. It should be remarked,
moreever, that the “expression “ reddidi et concessi,'' carries with it the
certainty that in seme sense er shape this advewsen in question had already
been in the grantee’s possession. It would almost seem as if the Abbet had
taken previous steps with the intention of transferring the advowson to John
Arundel, but those steps had proved abortivo, and that now, the hindering
causes having been removed, the said transfer-enee was finally and legally
made. It is at least open te surmise, that his first attempt had been made
during the vacancy of the living, and that finding he could not legally con-
vey the advewsen under such circumstances, he had made a rather hurried
presentatien, and then had proceeded to re-transfer the advowson according

te his first intention. ² See No. 101.
