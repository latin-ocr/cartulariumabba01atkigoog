Hackenas.¹ This measure of consentaneity between the two
authorities, independently of the intrinsic probability that such
raids of robbers by land and robbers by sea would surely be
made, renders it as nearly certain as possible that, subsequently
to some such act of robbery and devastation, the community
did take a temporary refuge, and of course at Hackness, the
seat of the ancient cell of the Whitby Monastery. And it

surely is not impossible, perhaps not even altogether unlikely,

that, in their absence, such a sub-grant as that specified in the
Domesday notice, and not in the least necessarily interfering

with the bona fide and still valid original grant of the ancient
abbey church‚ with its site and appurtenances,² may have
actually been conceded, on such considerations as those stated
a little above, or on others together with them, to the man who

was, it may be, already Abba-designate of York.
Up to the time of the Conqueror’s decease, and taking our

information from the Memorial, from Earl Hugh's charter, from

¹ 1 would drsw attention here to the discrepancy between the statement in
the narrative last referred to and the real facts of the case touching the
church of the cell or “monasterium ” oi Hacknessz—“Qua de causa,’' says this
writer, ‘⁸ Serlo Prior et Monachi de Whitby ostenderunt Willelmo de Percy
calamitatem suam at miserim, et petierunt illum ut daret eis locum manendi
apud Hackenas. Dedit eis ecclesiam Sanctoe Mariae de Hackenas ut ibi
construerent monasterium, quia in eadem villa S. Hilda Abbatissa monas-
terium construxerat.” Not only, however, does the memorialist expressly
state that Prior Reinfrid’s body was buried at Hackenas—“ in cimiterio S.
Petri in medio parietis contra altare,” and specify “ecclesiam S. Petri ubi
monachi nostri Deo servierunt, obierunt et sepulti sunt‚’' but the conqueror’s
confirmation secures to the said monks ecelesiam S. Petri de Hakenessa
cotemporaneonsly with the gift of the two carucates of Royal demesne
there, and the two additional carucates at Northfeld.
“ ² That the site and precincts οἱ the ancient abbey once given to Reinfrid
were ever alienated from any of his successore, or that such an attempt was
made, it seems impossible to believe. The original grant may have in-
cluded, and most likely did include, besides the said site, precincts and
buildings or ruins thereupon, a certain mount of territory—adjacens is not
an infrequent word in deeds of gift used in description of the land which
appertained to the church‚ or what not, given—and this adjoining territory
would be distinctly church land, and would remain such as effectually as
the site, precincts, etc. The grant to the Abbot of York might still be
easily iurnished forth out of lands in Soureby which were not church

landa.
