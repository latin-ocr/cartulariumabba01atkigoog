old name for Whitby than those that have hitherto been
suggested.

I have thought it well to give so much space to a notice of
the possible signification of the name and of the “local habita-
tion ’' of the ancient Streanaeshalch, because no small portion of
the interest attaching to the ancient history of Whitby—and it
is hard, if not impossible, to separate between the ecclesiastical
and the secular history in those old days—of necessity connects
itself with the elder monastery.

It has been noticed elsewhere that the materials for compiling
anything like a connected history of the pre-Norman Monastery
at Whitby are not only sufficiently scanty, but are also such
as not to be clear of many elementa of doubt and uncertainty.
Here, however, it may be sufficient to state that the main facts
of its foundation by Hild or Hilda, and of the date of the
foundation—namely, about two years after the battle of Win-
widfield (which was fought in November 654), may be looked
upon as resting on the positive testimony of Bede. It is not
clear how the lady Hild acquired possession of the land on
which the Monastery was built. Young says she “ purchased
a possession of ten hydes of land in a [he should have written
the] place called Streoneshalh,'' but admits in a note that
“ purchased” may not be the right word to employ, notwith-
standing that (as he adds) “ the Saxon version clearly states
that she ‘ bought' it ;'' the fact really being that the Saxon
version employs a word which no doubt means “ bought,'' but
also as certainly means “ procured ;’' while the Latin version
employs the terms, “ comparata possessione decem familiarum ”
(having become possessed of ten hides). Now Oswiu had
vowed, before Winwidfield, to give twelve possessions, if
victorious, for the building of monasteries; and, the victory
won, he gave them, six in Bernicia and six in Deira; of which
last district Cleveland was a constituent part. And as King
Oswiu’s daughter, with whom these “ possessions ’' were given,
entered the Monastery of Heoruteu, of which Hilda was then
abbesS, there seems to be every antecedent probability that the
“ decem familiae ” at Streoneshalch were a part of Oswy’s
original grant for monastery-building purposes.

The character, the dimensions, and the precise site of the
