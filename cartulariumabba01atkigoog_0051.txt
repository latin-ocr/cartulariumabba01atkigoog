INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. xlvii

Convent of Whitby was able, in virtue of the grant of Earl
Hugh of Chester, to allege a claim to the whole tithes and all
parochial customs (save only certain burial fees) belonging ιο
the Church of Midelesburg and arising out of the aforesaid
lands in the manerium of Aclum, and Robert de Brus, the
then owner of all, or nearly all, the Earl of Chester’s late interest
in the said manerium, and besides that the munificent founder
and special patron of one of the contending Houses, is himself
a party to “ the part ’' of the other house ¹—under such circum-
stances, 1 think it must be abundantly clear not only that the
original grant was sufficiently notorious and important, but
even so much so that any modification of its tenor required the
formal consent and co·operation of the original grantor's suc-
cessor and representative. And thus, taking into consideration
also, that not only did not the Church of Flamborough, with
its tithes, ever belong to Whitby-in fact it belonged ιο Brid-
lington ² in the next century—but that no reference, however
slight, is ever again made to the subject in the records of the
Abbey, I arrive at the conclusion that, in the charter now
under notice, although the name Fleinesburg is written, it was
so written, by a slip of the copyist's pen, instead of Midelesburg,
and that the church of the latter place, with all its tithes and
parochial customs (save only the exception noted above), and
other appurtenances (the endowment carucate of land, of course,
included), was granted⁸ by Hugh Earl of Chester‚ together with
the confirmation of the Church of St. Peter at Whitby, to Prior

² “ Hunc finem et concordiam inter praedictos Canonicos et Monachos con-
cessit et confirmavit ex sua parte Capitulum canonicorum de Giseburna, et
Capitulum Monachorum de Wytebi et Robertus de Brus ex parte sua.’'

² At p. 226 (Mon. Mor.) Burton notes the gift of the Cburch of Flame-
burgh ιο Bridlington by William FitzNigel ς and at page 72, in a note to the
statement in the text that Hugh Earl of chester gave the said church—and its
tithes to whitby, he adds—“ But 1 can't suppose it could mean Flamburg,
because that church was given to the Priory of Bridlington.'’

⁸ Of course it may be alleged that the chat-ter of Robert de Brus (No. 111)
involves the original gift and conveyance of the Churoh of Midelesburgh,
with all its appurtenances. It is probably sufficient ιο remark in reply that,
admitting the indisputable grant of that church and its tithes by the Earl of
chester, the char-ter in question is but a deed of renewed gift and confirma-
tion made requisita by the grantor’s secession to what was part and parcel
of the Earl of Chester's fee, as well as a conveyance of the new donatiou of
