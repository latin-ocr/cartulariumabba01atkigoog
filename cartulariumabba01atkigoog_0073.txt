tabile totiens memorati Willelmi violentia coacti,’' and under
the direct orders of the King, moreover‚ they migrated to
Lastingham.

But before proceeding to deduce any inference from this—
from whatever point of view regarded—somewhat startling in-
consistency between this part of the alleged Stephen narrative
and the Domesday returns, it may be well to try and ascertain
whether disparity of date may be suggested as affording a pos-
sible explanation, whether more or less satisfactory or reason-
able, of the said inconsistency.

The alleged Stephen states that in 1078, the twelfth year
of the Conqueror’s reign, he assumed the monkish habit at
Whitby3 that a few days after, as already noticed‚ he was
compelled by the urgent solicitations of Reinfrid and his
fraternity to assume also the Priorate‚ and that ultimately
(demum) he was made to be, through the combined pressure
of the King and both Archbishops‚ Abbot instead of Prior of
Whitby3 that time having been allowed for the working of
visible improvement in the place assigned to them, William
de Percy became their enemy, and that pirates and robbers
attacked them; whence originated an appeal to the King for
succour, the result of which was that Lastingham was given
them, and they began to build there; that then, they them-

opportunity for receiving the imposition of pontifical hands
and the benediction as Abbot‚ he resolved to go to Lastingham
and be consecrated Abbot of that place also, and that at length,
with the full approbation of the Archbishop‚ this scheme was
duly accomplished. It would seem that, allowing for the
necessarily gradual progress of improvement such as that
adverted to ; for the full commencement of other work else-
where after the wrecking of the aforesaid improvement3 allow-
ing also for his appeal to the King, and the working out of
his new plane, and obtaining the consent and approval of the
Archbishop and others consulted3 and finally, for the conse-
cration and benediction‚—we can hardly suppose so short a
period as three or four years would suffice. It seems nearly
imperative on us to ask a longer space. However, four years
