CCLXIV. CARTA WILLELMI 116 Eventu. [Μ. 49¹³]

Notum sit omnibus aud. et vid. 1166 litteras, quod eg0‚
secundus meamus? Abbas de wyteby, assensu totius Capituli
nostri, concessi et reddidi Willelmo [d]e Everle⁴ et haer. 61116,
16 feudum et haereditatem, Ugelbardeby et Everlay? cum omn.
pert. 61116, de nobis tenendas—Reddendo annuatim xi 6. et 1166111
precationem in Augusto de vi decim hominibus in Ugel-

‘⁸ boon days.” Under the circumstances—an exchange of lordship—Charl·
ton’s supposition (p. 78) that the former term means ‘⁴ two ox-gangs of land”
is clearly inadmissible, and his gratuitous supposition that ‘⁸ hercatorium ”
is 6 mistake for ‘⁸ hermitorium ” (ἰὰ, note) 110 1666 so. Young (p. 302, and
note) supposes carucata boum may be 6 team of oxen, and herculeo-ius &syres-
eus a 36113 or set of han-owe, but he is not satisfied with either suggestion.

¹ Alanus Magnus, 606 and heir of william Asgernuns.

² A form of Falco, not without interest3 the next witness is witness to

No. 88, 6 chartei· by Fulco Dapifer.

⁸ Richard (16 Waterville, 1177-1189.
⁴ There is some uncertaiuty 66 to the connection of this lord of Everley

with his predecessor or predecessore. There is reason to believe that deul·
phus de Everlay, 601116 notice of whom, in connection with the legendary
story of william de Percy's alienation of the lands of Everley from the new
monastery, in order that he might bestow them on 1116 esquire, is taken in
the Introductory Chapters, was the first lord of Everley under the restored
abbey. His name appears as that of 6 witness to several of the earliest
documents in the Chartulsry (Nos. 224, 240, 242, 405), and in the second of
these the name of “Hugo ejus filius” follows 1116, and 16 1116611 followed hy
that of Alanus de Everluie. Certainly it (1066 not follow that Hugo was his
eldest 606, any more than does the relationship of Alanus de Everlaie.
Assuming 1130-5 to he the 111-01161116 date of the 611611161- 16 question, it 16
possible, though not perhaps altogether probable, that the william de
Everlay of this deed 16 the grandson of deulsus. Be that as it may, he is
the first of a series of Williams de Everley. A second, probably his son, 16
6 cotemporsry of Abbot Roger (1220·1244). In Nos. 20, 21, dated 1311,
we meet with another william de Everley‚ with 6 6011 and heir, 6160
william de Everley. Between the cotemporary of Abhot Roget· aud the
elder of these two there is room for 611 inter-mediate generation, possibly
two. Μ. reads Everley for our Everle.
⁵ M. Ugelbarby et Everley.
