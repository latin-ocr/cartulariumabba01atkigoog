338 GARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY.

at once aeen to be more than justifiable. 'l'he first part of the boundary in
question, or from Howe Bridge along the Rye to the influx oi theSeven, and
thence to the source of the stream ao named, ia easily traced on any mode·
rately good map. From the said source to Ralph Crosa ia but a short step, of
under a mile. Crux Radulphi ie specially named in several of the Gyseburne
deeda aa one among the bounder-marke eervieeable iu marking off certain
granta by the house of de Brun to the Priory, and it ia still standing, and
the exietiug or modern boundary takes a fairly direct course to the next
mere or bounder. In the document before ua thia ia designated aa Weat
Shoner Howea, a name not recogniaable now, but beyond question identifi-
able aa the howee near white Croas in the Ordnanoe Survey. Lowaohowee
ie the modern Looee Howe 3 willelmi howee is represented by William Hiu in
the boundary between Danby ancl Roeedale aa it existed up to a quite recent
private arrangement between the lords of these adjoining manera, and iu what
ia practically the existing boundary of Cleveland. Est Shonerhowea ia Shunner
Howe on the map, ancl in the mouths of gamekeepera and the country folk 3
and {rom thence the Wheeldale gill and beck are apeedily reached. 'rhe
course of the Mirk Esk from thia point ia sufficiently obvious aa a bouudary 3
but a considerable difficulty present· itaeli in connection with the clauae,
“ et in longum Myr-ke Eake usque ad locum ubi Mirk Eek cadit in Eek, et in
longum Esk usque ad locum ubi Lithebeck cadit in Eake et inde ascendendo
per furcam de Lythebecke versus aquilonem, usque,'‘ ete. For Lithbeck falla
into the Mirk Eek, not into the Eak itself, and the united atreama flow
into the Esk3 neither ia there any “furca de Lythebecke.” There ia no way
in which the delineation of this part of the boundary can be made intelligi·
ble. The only supposition ia that the scribe blundered hia copy unmercifully,
ancl that he meant to say the boundary which, at the point where Lithebeck
falla into the Mirk Esk—only a few dozen yarda from Groamont Church—
becomes aleo the boundary of Whitby Liberty, after proceeding to the Eak
returns again to the point at which Lithebeck falls into Mirk Eak, and,
making a fork there with ita former course, proceeds thence to Calverleygate
and ao, forward. Now here, reference may be made to the boundary aa
given in the Percy Chartera, ancl divers royal and other confirmations (aee
Noa. 27—the second ao numbered—ISG, 190, etc.), only premiaing that the
course of boundary described in the present document ia in the direction
opposite to that taken in the documenta just cited. In the latter we go
from Lithebeck back to Sylehow3 in the present case from Lithebeck to
Calverleygate‚ thence along below the brae to the Mickle Stone (possibly
connected with what are now called the Bride Stonea), and thence in like
manner—that is, along below the brae—to Sillhowea. In the Whitby
boundary, again, it ia back from Sylehow to Scograineehowee5 in the docu-
ment before ua, the course ia from Sillhowea ιο Foraterhowea—now Foster
Howee—and thence to Scotgranehowea (aee Note 23 ιο No. 27—aeeond ao
numbered), Foeterhowes not being named in the Whitby line. From Scot-
granehowee to Lillehowea, in the Whitby deeda Lillacroa or Lillehowcroe,
and from thence, in both alike‚ to the aource of the Derwent. Then along the
