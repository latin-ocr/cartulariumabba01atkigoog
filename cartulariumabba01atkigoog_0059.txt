IN TRODUCTORY OHAPTERS. lv

The facts then are patent that Prior Reinfrid’s eon held an
office of distinction in a great family, and that he was suffi-
ciently well feoffed under another great family to be able to
bestow a donation of two carucates upon the rising Abbey of
Whitby: both of them facts not very consistent with the fore-
gone conclusion as to the poor estate of the father, antecedently
to his becoming Prior of the reviving monastery of that
place.¹

Passing these several consideratione under revieW, it is seen
to be very difficult to accord our belief to several of the state-
ments in the narrative of the alleged Stephen. On the face of

οι· Osbert de Archee, held οι him by Fulco filiun Reiniridi Dapifer. But
besides, the following ie ιο be noted ·—

“In Snechintnne habuit Blacre‘ 1 carucatam terrae et dimidiam ad geldam,
et ι σει-ια, pote-t ihi eoae. Nunc habet Falco de willelmo (de Poed).1poe
ibi· 1 carucatam et v villane-3 dimidiam meam et ii acras prati.

“In Inglveetvet habuit Gamel viii carucatas terrm ad geldam, nbi possunt
esse iiii carucae. Nunc habet Pulcherus de willelmo, et wantum eet.² ”

Thus Fulcho appears to have held largely undet both semnion, de Perci
and de Areia.

¹ There is a remarkable entry in Dodsworth, vol. ii. p. 2¹³, which may
possibly throw some light on the birth and extraction of Prior Reinfrid. It
ie involved in the following transcript :—

“Carta 31 Edw. i. m. 1.

“Rex omnibus etc. Inspeximus cartam Henrici Regis, patris nostri, in
haec verba z—Henricne, Rex Angliae, etc. Sciatis noa confirmasse ecclesiae
Sancta Mariae et monialibus de Appleton etc. Ex dono Alicioe de Sancto
Quintino scitum loci etc. ι Ex dono Roberti, filii Roberti filii Fulconin, filii
praedictae Alicio de S. Quintino, terrae in Immingham: Ex dono Roberti
Dapiferi et Roeeiee uxoris euae ecclesiam de North Elkington: Ex dono
willelmi de Kyma xxx acras t'rae in Elkington, cum communi pastura
quantum pertinet ad ii bovatas t’ ιιι ejusdem villae. Has autem ιιι acras
t’ ιω dedit eis pro ii bovatis quae Robertus Dapifer‚ pater Margaretae, uxoris
suae, eis dedit die obitus sui. Dat. ΔΟ regni noetri xxxiii.”

Το this Dodsworth appende a short genealogical table, showing that Alicia
de St. Quintin was daughter to Aymer de Arches, founder of the monastery
of Keeling, and that her son Fulcho was father of Robert and Gilbert. But
Fulcho filius Reinfridi is father of Robert and Gilbert also; and the proba-
bility is, ae Roeaia was a widow in 4 Hem-y ιιι. [Η.Η.Η. 55] (1223), and
thus the date· would accommodate themselves fairly well, that the Fulcho
mentioned in the above confirmation is also the eon of Reinfrid‚ and that
thus some further clew to the condition and connectione of Prior Reinfrid is
given us.
