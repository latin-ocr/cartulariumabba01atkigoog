cerned, would have amounted‚ in its execution, to the de sacto
breaking up of both copies into a series of fragmentS, and
reuniting them with an arbitrary tie, with the result of de-
stroying the identity of either copy. Rearrangement on the
principle of juxtaposition of documents of like character seemed
open, on the same grounds, to a similar objection. The Editor,
therefore, after mature deliberation, deemed it best to print the
Whitby copy as it stands, following it up with the additional
documeuts obtained from the Museum copy in due sequence,
and with those obtained from other sources next in successim,
numbering them all in order, and by aid of these, numbers in
every case referring the reader to those documents which in
any way belonged to the same group. And, on the whole, it is
hoped that this mode wiu be found on experience to have all
’ the advantages of either of the others adverted to above, so
far as feasible‚ without the corresponding drawbacks or disad—

vantageS.
