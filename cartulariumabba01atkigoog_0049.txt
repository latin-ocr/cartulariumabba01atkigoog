of the Conventio between the houses of Gyseburn and Whitby,
made in the presence of Robert de Brus (N ο. 271), and to which,
moreover, the same baron, conjointly with the Convent of
Whitby, was a party, is sufficiently remarkable. The dispute
was touching “ totam decimam et omnes parochianas consuetu-
dines ad ecclesiam de Midlesburg pertinentes de xii carucatis

Latin—“Hunc finem et concordiam inter praedictos canonicos et monachos
concessit et confirmavit ex sua parte Capitulum canonicorum de Gisebumia,
et Capitulum Menaenorum de Wytebi et Robertus de Brus ex parte sua”—
in the following words :—“ This conclusion and agreement between the
aforesaid canons and monks was allowed of, and confirmed on the one
part (1) by the Chapter of the Canons of Giseburn and the Chapter
of the Monks of Whithy, aud on the other part (Σ) by Robert de
Brus.'’ Surely ignorant and blundering miscouception could no further
go, and we may hold ourselves quite prepared to find that Chariton
(p. 52) notices the chax-ter hitherto more immediately in question, thus:
—“ Also Hugh Earl of Chester granoed them the following charter‚’' append-
ing a translation which is slightly incorrect in two particulare, and then
proceeding—“ By this charter it appears that the Earl of Chester did not
at first sus-render ιο Lord william de Perci all right and title he had to those
lands, etc„ that lay about Whitby, nor convey them to him absolutely as
frechold ; but either resen-ved a part, or else, as Lord Par-amount, received
some quitrent, homage, or service for the whole.” Then follows one of the
author's characteristic rech-less and utterly baseless statements to the effect
that, on these grounds, may be partly understood the residence of “ Percy
for many years at Sneton before he granted anything by chat-ter to the
Monastery of Whitby !’' After which he proceeds to say—‘⁸ However those
lande were all ceded to him as freehold before he entered into the crusade,
and they are mentioned as such by his son Alan not long after that time.
As for Flambrough ”-and again we meet with an utterly groundless asser-
tion—“ Earl Hugh, soon after the conquest, settled a colony of Flanderkins
or Flemiugs in those parts, who built a church aud town there ; and from them
it took the denomination of Flammeuville Flammeville, Fleinesburgh or
Flamborouglu by some of which names it has been known ever since.” And
this, to say nothing of the gratuitous confusion between the two names
Flammavilla and Fleinesburg—Flaneburg in Domesday-notwithstauding
the distinct statement in the record just named that the place in question not
only had its name and local designation in Edward the confessor-’s time,
but was then a thriving manerium, geldable in no less a sum than 2224, and
held by no less a personage than “Harold Comes.” Moreover, all the
special notice conceded to the most noteworthy matter iu the whole
transaction-the alleged grant of a church aud its appurtenances, which
transparently never was so given—is the following sentence =—“ The church
there (at Flamborough) was in the next century ceded (Ι) ιο the Prior-y of
Bridlington, but on what consideration does not appear.'’
