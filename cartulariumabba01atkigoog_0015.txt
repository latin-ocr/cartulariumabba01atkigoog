not unimportant‚ is true. He also remarks that “ a
number of the charters belonging to the Abbey are not
to be found in this volume,'' 38 3180 that “ this book is
not the only Whitby Register ; for we find in Tanner's
Nocitia (p. 632) that there was another bought at a
sale ΒΥ 1118 Earl of Kent ; besides others consulted by
Dodsworth. ”¹ Both these statements are also correct ;
and in the second of the present volumes will be found
upwards of 150 charters mainly derived from another
copy of the Chartulary preserved among the “ ADDI-
TIONAL MSS.’' series in the British Museum, several
others also coming from original sources or from
Dodsworth's collectim? As regards the copy pur-
chased by the Earl of Kent‚ it has, so far, been found
impossible to trace it.- No clew even to what may
possibly have become of it seems to be obtainable.
This is unfortunate, for, to judge by what 1138 Β8811
given up by the Museum copy—even when the exist-
ing lacunae in it are allowed for—several of the im-
portant early charters known to be missing might
possibly, or even probably, have been recovered in it.
Unhappily too much that must have been in existence
in Charlton's time, and even in Dr. Young’s‚ has now
disappeared3 while from entries in Dodsworth it is
apparent that, at a date about a century earlier than
Charlton's, other important historical documents were

² The Muscam copy, which is marked “Add. 1188. 4715,” will be more
specifically dealt with in the second volume, where the conclusione arrived
at by the editor as to the other possible or supposed copies assumed to have
been available by Dodsworth or the writers he copies from, will also be stated.
