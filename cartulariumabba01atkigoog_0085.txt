place of a Priory, and endow it with accordant liberality, may
have been, probably were, cotemporaneous, or, at all events, due
to the same religious impulse. And there are certainly features
in the charter which seem to bespeak the presence of more than
usual earnestness and solemnity in the grantor's mind and
intention. The Archbishop himself, besides the Founder’s wife,
his heir, also two more of his sons (Walter, the second, and
xvimam, the canon), his near kinsman‚ Ernald the founder of
the Kildale family, Gilbert fitz Adelard (witness to the Earl of
Chester’s charter), are all present, and all—at least all the mem-
bers of the family named, and especially the Primate in his
ecclesiastical capacity—formally joining with himself in the
grant, concession, and confirmation of the lordly gift :—“ Huic
dono affuerunt testes et concessores Thomas Archiepiscopus
Ebor¹, Emma de Port uxor mea, Alanus, Walterus, WillelmuS,
filij mei,'' etc. Surely no occasion can be imagined more suited
to call forth such unusual manifestation‚ on the part of a great
benefactor, of an earnest solicitude that his grants should have
every possible sanction, and especially on the part of those most
nearly concerned in the lands and possessions proposed to be,
and now actually and formally, alienated, than one on which
the said benefactor stood on the verge of an enterprise in which,
advanced in years as he already was, he was about to expose
himself to all the perils of travel and hardship, sickness and
warine, and from which, humanly speaking, the chauces of his
return in safety could scarcely, in any sense, be considered
hopequ

But there is still another point in the charter to which atten-
tion should be given—I mean the terms in which the object for
which the old grants are confirmed, and so largely augmented
by new—namely, “ ad fundandam Abbatiam olim destructam’'
—for the refounding of the Abbacy long ago destroyed. The
fact being that, unquestionably within the four years next
succeeding our supposed date, the Priory was exchanged for

¹ Of course there is an opening for the suggestion that tho impulse under
which william de Perci was acting, alike in assuming tho Cross and endow·
ing the Abbacy with angmented gifts, may have been cognate with that
already adverted to in the note to p. lxxviii, in speaking of Nigel de Albini's
restoration of the half carucata of land at Thorp to the All saints Cell at
York. In other words, religious compunction, in whatever way excited,
may be supposed as the aetuating influence in William de Perci’s beart.
