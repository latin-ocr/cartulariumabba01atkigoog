equipment borne on the back of a single ass, reach Monk-
chester, and eventually settle, for a time at least, at J arroW.
Having seen his efforts here crowned with a measure of success,
Aldwine‚ contemplating a repetition of like efforts elsewhere,
departs from J ari-ow, leaving one of his two chosen associates
in the holy work—namely‚ Elwy—there, and taking with him
the other—that is, Reinfrid—who in the sequel sepas-ates from
him, and betakes himself to Streoneshalch‚ “ which is also
named Hwiteby,'' and there proceeds to organise a society of

Iu the neighbouring house of Evesham he found two brethren likeminded
with himself—fflwine, a descen, and Regmfrith, seemingly a lay-brother.
The three set forth ou foot, with sn sss to carry their books sud vestments.
In this guise they reached York‚ aud prayed the Sheriff of the shire, Hugh
