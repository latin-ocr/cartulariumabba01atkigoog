carucate of land, on certain conditione (somewhat curione in themselves), &ther-
Robert de Brus, Agnes his wife, Adam his elder son, william son of the
latter, and Robert de Brun, J uvenis‚ being among the witnesses. The latter,
as well as william de Brus, Adam’s son, is a grandson of Robert de Brun,
then of Danby, the founder of Gysburne, and this fact throws the date of
the chal-ter towards the latter part of Robert’s life, or to about the time
alleged by Chai-lton. The present chax-ter brings both Alan de Ferlington
and his father Badulfus into connection with Wilton as lords thereos—the
alienated tithes were the tithes of the ‘⁴ dominium ;” and beyond doubt their
connection with Wilton originated iu their connection, as sub-feudatories,
with the Fossa-ds, who held of the Earl of Mortain, not only at Wilton but
at Bulmer, Ferlington, Welburne‚ Lilling, etc„ and were succeeded by the
Manleys in the ‘seignorsn As to the deseent and connection of the Bulmera
and Ferlingtons, in a Quo Warranto Roll of 21 Edw. 1.‚ is a record of a suit
in which John de Bulmer is plaintiff‚ and the Prior of Helagh Park defendant,
touching the advowson of the Hospital of S. Nicholae‚ Yarm. De Bulmer
claime “quod quidam Alanus, antecessor suus, fuit in seisina de praed.
advoc„ ut de feodo et jure haered.. tempore D’ni Regis Ricardi, etc. . . .
Et de ipso Alano, quia obiit s. h. etc„ descendit jus cuidam Thomae ut
fratri et haeredi . . . et de ipso Thoma‚ quia obiit s. h. de se reforciabatur
jus cuidam Stephano, fratri cujusdam Alani, avi praed. Alani, ut consan-
guineo et haeredi. Et de ipso Stephano descendit jus cuidam J ohanni, ut
filio et haeredi 3 et de ipso J ohanni descendit jus cuidam Johanni ut filio et
haeredi ς et de ipso J ohanne desc. jus isti J ohanni qui nunc petit, ut filio et
haeredi, etc.'’ 'We have thus Alan, the grandfather of Alan and Thomas de
Wilton, identified as brother of Stephen de Bulmer, the great-grandfather of
John de Bulmer, son of John de Bulmer, who, as “ consanguineus et haeres,'’
succeeded to the Wilton inheritance on the decease of Thomas de Wilton (a
priest), ap. But Alan de Wilton’s father was Radulfus de Wilton. Dods·
worth gives several extracta from the chartulary of Helagh‚ and one three
times over (vol. 116, f. 78¹², etc.) :—“ Alan' de Wilton pro animabus Mariae
uxoris suae, et Radulfi patris sui, et Ceciliae matris suae,” his sistere, ances-
tore, and others, makes grant in Hutton Rudby, etc. We thus have
Radulsus (de Bulmer) de Ferlingtom father of the grantor of this chat-ter,
presumably by his wife Anfrida, and also of Stephen de Bulmer, immediate
ancestor of the future John de Bulmer de Wilton. Alan de Ferlington‚ the
said grantor, is succeeded in the lordship of Wilton by his son Radulfus,
who dropo the title de Ferlington in order to take that of de wilton, and
who in turn is succeeded by his son Alan de Wilton. As to Radulfus de
