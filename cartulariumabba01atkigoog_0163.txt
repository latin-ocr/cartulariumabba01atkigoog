of the point to observe that, in a side-note in the list of the knights of the
Percy see adver-ted to above, william de Argentom is alleged to heve held his
one knight's fee partly in Uplium and partly in Lofthus, as also that in Bur-ton
(Mon. Ebor. p. 353), william de Argentin is stated to have given land in
Uplium to Gysebnrn with the consent of Julian, his wife, and Roger and
Agnes, their son and daughter. This confirms the memorandum as ιο Wil-
liam’s son Roget. It is probable also that the Percys had an interest in
Ugthorpe, as the name Percybiggyng is one which occurs in the Gysburne
chartei-s in connection with Ugthorpe‚ end this may indicate the site of the
land held there by the Argentoms end of the Percys. ² M. Uplium.

² The word which follows Regis is unintelligible. It looks like iomss or
ioniss, the first s being a long one.

⁸ “The Whitsuntide of 1170 was however marked by a more critical
event than the inquest of Sheriffs. The heir was crowned as Heni-y ηις
the ceremony was performed, not by Thomas oi Cantor-bury but by Roger of
York, and the wife of the young king was not crowned with him. This
act, which was intended by Henry as a sign and seal of power, was a most
unfortunate mistnke. He had, not unnaturally, supposed that it would
*strengthen the supreme authority to have in each division of his dominicus
a sufficient representative of royal majesty, he found that he had placed a
dangerous weapon in the hands of an undutiful son ς the minor irregularities
of the coronation day roused his enemies to frenzy 3 Thomas Becket asserted
that the rights of Canterbury, of the English Chul-ch, of Christianity iteelf,
were outraged by Archbishop Roger’s intr-usion 3 and Levis vn„ burt at the
neglect of his daughter, and backed by the support of the family of Cham-
pegne, who combined careful orthodoxy with intense hatred of the house of
Anien, urged the Pope ιο put the kingdom under interdict.”——(Stubbs’s
Come. Hm. i. 474). ⁴ No other witnesses in M.
