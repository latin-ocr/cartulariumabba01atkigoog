an Abbacy, the language 11818 employed appears to be signifi-
cant ;1 and the circumstance that the grant is made to Prior
Ser10‚ and the monks serving God at Whitby, makes it in so far
more probable that the measures which were already taken, or
were to be taken in the close sequel, for raising the House to a
higher dignity, were designed and carried out with the existing
Prior’s full concurrence. Probably, t00‚ the appointment 01 1118
11181 Α111101 would follow at no very remote date after the exe-
cution of the charter and the formal completion of its purpose.

At least this much is certain, that William de Percy had
been created Abbot antecedently to the year 1100,2 8110 among
the charters printed in the text is one by Hem-y 1. (No.
190) 800188880 10 Archbishop Thomas of York, Osbert the
Sheriff, Nigel de Albini, and Aschetil de Bulmer‚ which
contains the following remarkable clause :--“ Sciatis quod
Willelmus‚ Abbas de Wyteby‚ et monachi illius loci deder-
unt michi in forestis suis omnes cervos et cervas et porcoS,
et ego illos forestavi michi et haeredibus meis.'’ That this gift
or concession had been made in the guise of a quid pro quo I
suppose must be regarded as an absolute certainty. It 18 of
course possible that it was in return for it that the King grants
1118 full confirmation which the remaining part of the charter
conveys. But with the great accumulation of benefactions
which had recently fiowed in upon the Whitby House from the
various branches of the Pei-ci family and their connections
(not to mention other benaia-stom), it 18 hardly reasonable to
suppose that there could have been any difficulty about the
customary money acknowledgment for such a concession on
the part of the reigning King3 and 11881088, 1118 disproportion
between the concession made by the Abbot 8110 monks to the
King, and the King’s concession to them, is far too great to
