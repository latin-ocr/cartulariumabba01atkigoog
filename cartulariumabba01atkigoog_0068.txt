Perci’s demesne, the remainder (whether four carucates or six)
is specifically St. Hilda's land and of the fee of William de

Perci.

How long this had been the case there is of course no means
of ascertaining, so far as the Domesday Record itself is con-
cerned; the fact remains nevertheless: and assuming the date
alleged in the Stephen narrative to be a probable one—which
I think it may be affirmed to be by the common assent of all
writers on the subject—and that the first donation followed
hard on Reinfrid's initiatory proceedings at Whitby, we have
but a period of seven or eight years to assign as the period of
possession previously to the Domesday inquiry.¹ Beyond all
question, however, the grant of the two carucates at Hackncss
by the King—-and these of course must be the two in soke of
the Walesgrif manerium—must have been made subsequently
to the year 1086, and thus, I think, a date approximate to
within a few 1110111116, 16 arrived at for the Royal grant, of the
specified lands at HackneSS‚ Nordfeld and Briniston. For, from
the considerations already advanced, and which appear to me
to be of such a nature as to be altogether conclusive, it is
entirely apparent, first, that the charter in which the gift of the

¹ There is another consideration tending to show that the monastic 0011-
nection oi Hackness, aud especially through the church of St. Peter there,
was 066 of old and long-continued standing. In the charter of confirmation

granted by william de Pei-cy, 6011 of Alan de Percy, and grandson of
william (16 Percy (Ove les geruuns, the Refounder) (N 0. 26), after the men·

tion oi Hackanessa and the Church of St. Mar-y in the 661116 vill, we find
the further mention of ‘⁶ the Church of St. Peter, with all its appurtenances ’'
confirmed with the intent 11161 “ 06116111 monks of the aforesaid church of
Whitby may continuously sojourn there, and serve God and St. Hilda
praying for the souls” specified 61 1116 beginning oi the charter. And on
examination this clause 16 66611 10 be a 1611661661, almost verbatim, of 6
clause in the 01161161· oi william (16 Percy, the founder, where it stands “ et

is, not 11161 1116 Church of St. Mary was 6 later grant, which we know it was,
but that it was 6 grant in augmentation of 611 existing monastic foundation
