xlii INTRODUO'I'ORY cHA PTERS.

It is important to notice the correspondence-—coincidence
almost—as to all material points between the two accounts so
far collated. For they are both nearly, though not quite,
equally ancient, and, as it would appear, independent. 01
0011188 it is possible that the Whitby scribe may have seen and
perused Symeon' s History, but it is by no means incumbent
on us to assume it as probable. There is certainly nothing in
the Memorial to suggest such a probability3 and, moreover,
assuming the earliest date alleged for the composition of the
History‚ and the latest for the penning 01 the Memorial, still
the interval is only short. Besides all which, the transactione
recorded in the former had taken place not so long before that
the recollection of them in their very birthplace and theatre
was likely to have become dim, or the memory of their reciter
to require refreshing from the stores of another man’s know-
ledge, wh0, at the most, besides not being an eye-witness him-
8811, could scarcely have been much more than a generation
1188181 the time of their happening.

To resume t—The Whitby Memorialist goes on to say that
Reinfrid came to william de Perci, who gave him the old
Monastery 01 St. Peter and two carucates of land in Prestebi‚ in
perpetual alms, the former being in much the same state of ruin

as that described by Symeon in the case of J arrow-——nothing
left, that is, but roofless walls and unsheltered altars. Reiu-
frid, however, diligently and patiently availing himself of the
means at 1118 disposal, succeeded within a short time in gather-
ing about him a band of pious and prudent men as ready as
himself to adopt the monastic habit and submit to monastic
discipline under his immediate rule as Prion and after several

ignorant 01 letters, went forth 88 the reviver 01 the monastery 01 Whitby,
once, 11111181· the older name 01 Streoneshalh, the holy 1101188 01 Η1111, the
daughter 01 the Bretwalda Oswiu. From Whitby sprang another famous
house3 11111181· the care 01 Earl Alan, 81111 under the government 01 its first
Abbot Stephen, the church 01 Earl Siward at Galmauho grew into the great
Abbey 01 Saint Mai-y without the walls 01 York.” It will be observed that
Mr. Freeman in every case adopts the true spelling 01 the ρει-801181 11811188
involved—Regenfrith, Ealdwine, .AElfwine, Oswiu, 111 place 01 Reinfrid or
neuin-id, Aldwin, Elfwy, Oswy. In a book which is little more than a tran-
script 01 charters it may be better to 81111818 to the forms which alone are
found in them, indicating from time to time, 88 occasion may 81188, the true
form from which the more uncommon names that occur have been changed.
