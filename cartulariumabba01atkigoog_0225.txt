CARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 129

¹ M. Hornegard. Both Young and Charlton deal with the absurd fable—
for it can hardly be called legend—which professes to explain the origin of
the service called Horugarth‚ the former at pp. 308·314, the latter, pp.
125-132, and both of them expose the historical misstatements and contra-
dictione involved in it3 but both of them are equally at a loss to assigu a
reasonable explanation of either origin or object iu its place. Youug says—
“ What was the use of this gat-th it is not so easy to ascertain. Perhaps it
was the Abbot's cosi-yard, where the coals for the monastery were delivered
aud laid up; or it might be, as Chariton conjectures, a kind of storo-yard,
where goods were lauded and deposited.’' Chariton’s guenes, or some of
them, will be found at p. 128. There is no need to deal with any of them
iu detail; they are all equally unsatisfactory, not to say absurd. There cau
be no question as to the antiquity of the service, inasmuch as in N o. 265
Abbot Beuedict, in reuewiug to william de Percy, son of Richard de Percy
de Dunsley‚ the plenary grant of that territory as previously enjoyed by his
father, specifles a yearly payment of two marks iu lieu of all other services,
‘⁴ excepto Hornegarth quantum ad terram suam pertinet.’' This carries
back the existence of the service in question to the times of the Founder,
the aforesaid Richard de Percy being his son. There cau be equally little in
the way of question as ιο the comprehensive nature of the obligation to
render the said service ; it seems clearly to have been compulsor-y on all the
“homiues,” or sub-feudatories, of the Abbey. Charlton notes this, p. 130,
specifyiug, and quite correctly, those who held Duusley, Sueten, Everley‚
Ugglebardby‚ Sleights, Fylingdales‚ and iuferring the same of all the
homagers in the Liberty. The only real questions are as ιο the nature and
extent of the service itself. Tbat it was the making up of a fence of some
sort may be assumed as a matter of course. That the fence was a very real
one, and of considerable extent, is sufficieutly indicated by the fact that
enough wood was required for making the part allotted to only one of the
teuants or homagers‚ to make it worth the while of the men employed, to do
a bit of peculation with the surplus, and, more inferentially, that it required
the labour of a number of men to complete such part. See No. 380, fourth
article, wherein both of these positious are amply supported, Suetou being
the place, and Alexander de Percy the person, in questiou; and wherein,
moreover, the question of the personat service of the various “ homiues '’
