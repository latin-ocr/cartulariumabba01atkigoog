INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. xxiii

a great conical hill in Cleveland,1 near Moorsom‚ which re-
mains to tell where the meare-mot of its district used to be held
—and the “ Wapentake ” and “ Thing-stead '’ remain to tell us
of the pervading change which had come over the institutione
of the fair country which had been re·named Clifflond by its
new lords ; and, in telling us of this, the Whitby Thingwala
tells ue, incidentally it is true, but also most emphatically,
that Whitby, under the occupatiori and rule of the Dones, was,
out of all Cleveland, by far the most important and the most
frequented town, as being the seat of all their principa] civil
and religione procedures and observances.

But this fact, as it seems to me, is not very consistent, any
more than that of the tolerably well-established character of
the hardy Northmen as vigor-ons sarmers, persevering tradere,
adventurous navigator-s, with the notion that the town of
Whitby, as well as its monastery, lay desolate and in ruins
until the restoration of the Abbey in N orman times,

But the matter is placed quite beyond dispute—and my
marvel is that such a painstaking and careful man as Young
undoubtedly was should have overlooked the testimony I am
about to quote—by the direct evidence of the Domesday
remma, which I will give as briefly as Ι can. The geldable
value of the manor of Whitby then, with the Berewic of
Sneton, containing fifteen carucates, but having soke also in
Fyling, Gnipe, Prestebi, Ugleberdesbi‚ Sourebi‚ Brecca‚ Florum,
Stachesbi, and Newham‚ to the extent of 282 carucates more,
was, in the time of King Edward‚ ΕΙ 12. On looking over
corresponding entrieS, connected with the more important
Cleveland localities, we find the following t—in the manor of
Locthusum (now Lofthouse), with 4 carucates, and soke in
various other townships and parishes, amounting in all to
nearly 47 carucates besides, the geldable value was 2248. At
Stocheslaye (Stokesley)‚ with a manor of 6 carucate8‚ and soke
of 341} carucates more in seven other places, the value is set at
224. At Hoton (Hutton Rudby)‚ with 6 carucates, and soke
of 20 carucates more in other places, the sum set down is 224.
On comparison then, Whitby, with a total of a 432 carucates, is
rated at 1:1123 Lofthouse‚ with nearly 51 carucate8‚ at 2483
