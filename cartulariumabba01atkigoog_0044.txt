The statement in the Memorial ¹ is that Reinfrid, while
he was yet a very energetic soldier (“ miles strenuissimus ”) ² in
the service of the Conqueror, during a journey or march through
N orthumbria, turned aside to visit Streoneshaloh, and that he
was pricked to the heart at the tokens os ruin and desolation
which obtruded themselves on his notice there; that thereafter,
having become a monk at Evesham, and having been well
trained at that convent in monastic discipline, he finally
returned„ under the Divine guidance into Northumbria, in
company with Aldwine‚ Prior of Winchcumbe, and the monk
Elwine, and with the avowed intention of reviving the monkish
profession in the aforesaid district.

I pause here to remark that all this is perfectly consistent
with the narrative of Symeon of Durham, according to whom
Aidwine, a Mercian presbyter, and prior of the monastery of
wincelcumbe, animated by a desire to visit a scene so famous
as N orthumbria had been for monastic piety‚ and to become
himself an emulator of the ancient solitaries in the same dis-
trict, repairs to Evesham monastery, and induces two members
of the society there to join him in his plan and undertaking.
One of these was the presbyter Elrwy, the other a man named
Remu-id, who is described as being “ignarus litterarum ”—a
character which precisely suits the man whose career had been
such that he could be fittingly spoken of as “ miles strenuissi-

¹ For myself, and for the reasons briefly stated here, but which will
become more apparent as we proceed‚ I am disposed to attach almost com-
plete credit to the statements in question. They are quite consistent with
each other; they are consistent with, or corroborated by, those in other
writings which are known to be worthy of credit; they are to a very great
degree corroborated by the existing Char-tera and other like documenta con-
nected with the Abbey, and in no case discredited by them ; and they are
contradicted by, or inconsistent with, only the statements made in a writing
which is of doubtful authority, if not uncertain origin, the said statements
or assertions involving issues which are not consistent with each other, with
known facts, or with common sense and reason.

² 1 do not dwell on the possible force of the word “miles‚” or intend to
claim for it the meaning it would undoubtedly bear two or three generations
later. But I would ask attention to the fact that the same term is applied,
in the course of the seli-same memorial, to Alan de Munceus, who was
certainly no mere parvam, but a man of distinction.
