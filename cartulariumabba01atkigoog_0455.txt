THE SURTEES SOOIETY.

REPORT FOR THE YEAR MD.OOO.LXXIX.

Smer: the last Report was issued‚ the progress of the
Stm'rnsss Socm‘rr has been marked by few changes, certainly
by no diminution in its usefulness and prosperity. The
effect of the limitation of the number of members to three
hundred and fifty has been a decided gain to the Society in
the acquisition of a settled income sufficient for the work to
be undertaken‚ and in the avoidance of continual changes in
the number of copies of our publicatione.

The Council have now resolved that no volume shall be
sent to a member whose subscription is unpaid for the year
to which that volume is appropriated.

Four volumes have been published since the last Report
was issued. 1. An interesting volume of Yorkshire Bio-
graphies and J ournals‚ which has attracted considerable
attention. 2. The Charter-book of the Cistercian house of
Newminster in Northumberland. 3. A Second Portion of
the Memorials of Fountains Abbey‚ part of which was in
print at the time of the decease of its lamented editor,
Mr. Walbran. 4. The Household Books of Lord William
Howard of Naworth‚ the ‘ Belted Will ' of Border story, a
work of great interest and historical importance. There
is no lack of valuable materials at the disposal of the Society
for coming year8‚ as will be seen from the list of suggested

publications'. It may have to be considered before long

whether it will not be better for the Society to 12>egin a
