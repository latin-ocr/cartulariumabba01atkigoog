INTRODUCTORY OHAPTERS. lxiii

existing there, 8811 possessing 188118 8811 rights, than to suppose
the old connection between Whitby and Hackness had been
lost sight of, and was now, for the first time since 869, recalled
to mind and acted on.

At least thus much is 111808158888111)γ clear—that when Domes-
day was compiled there was land at Hackness which was
definitely the land of St. Hilda. The entry, among the 188118
of william de Perci, involving Hackness is as follows :—
“ MANERIUM. In Hagenesse‚ et Sudfelt, et Evrelai sunt viii
carucatae terrae ad geldum, ubi possunt esse v carucae. De hac
terra sunt ii carucatae in soca Walesgrip3 et aliae sunt de t'ra
S. Hildae. N unc habet Willelmus ibi ii carucatas et xiiii
villanos, et 1111 11011181108 81118 1111 88111818. 1111 111 888188138 et
presbiter ..... Τ. R. E. valebat vii 1111188, 180110 xx solidosss'
And in the summary at the end there is this further addition
to the information thus conveyed :—“ In Sudfelt et Evrelag‚”
held by william de Perci, were “ vi carucatae‚” and in ‘⁴ Hag-
8118888 1111 carucatae.'' The sum thus given is ten carucates
88 against eight specified in the earlier entry. But without
troubling ourselves with the question whether the discrepancy
is due to 8 mistake of the scribe, or to some other cause, it is
clear that in 1086, while two carucates are still in soke of the
Royal manerium of Walesgrif, 81111 two are in William de

88 808 only “Testes,” but “Concesseres.'’ In the first 8888 118 grants the
81181811 οἱ St. Peter at Whitby, “et 018818 qnae ad 8818 pertinent,’' which
grant 1 look upon as in part expanded and explained, 88 well 88 confirmed,
by the Charter οἱ william the Conqueror (No. 184); for, besides the Port
and its waters, forest and forest rights, a variety of other privileges and
libet-ties are named, only consistent with the possession of considerable
domains and eeclesiastical endowments. In the second he confir-ms the
former gift, with fuller details 88 to what really and specially appertained
to the chureh of St. Peter, inclusive of the port, and with the addition of
St. Mary's Chul-oh at Hackneu, and 8 variety of tithes 81111 other profits
elsewhere. And 18 18 80 118 remarked in reference 80 “ other sources of
informationi or deduction,” that the memorialist speaks with entire precision
of just two such periods of benefaction 08 8118 part of William de Per-ci.
His words are: “Omnes terras, possessiones, forestas, ecclesias, decimas et
libertates quas saepenominatus idem willelmus 118 Ρ8181, cum Alano de
Perei filio 880, Μο88888110 de witebi dederat inprimi& necnon in ultimis
temporibus suis antequam Ierosolimarn peteret.’' This last clause 18 im-
portant as going near 80 fix the (1888 of the later 81111 fuller donation.
