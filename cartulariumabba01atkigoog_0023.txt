IN TROD Uc'rORY OHAPTERs. xix

Oswiu himself presided at this couneil, and besides him were
present his son Alchfrid, who was also a reigning 111-11100 ; Bishops
Colman and Agilberct, each with a train of clergy; Romanus,
the Queen's chaplain; the venerable «1011100, long associated
with Paulinus; and of course the lady Hilda herself. There
is no need here to dwell on the issue of the Synod. It is the
fact of the Synod itself which arrests the attention and fixes
our thoughts for a moment as we proceed, helping us to realise
one little scene 111 the veritable life and action of those dayS,
and to localise it as having been enacted on a stage, the sceuery
01 which our own eyes may be familiar with as belonging to
one of the pleasant places of modern seaside resort.

Nor was it only thus that Streoneshalch was a place of
importance and distinction: The institution from among
whose foster-children a poet like Caedmon (setting altogether
on 0110 side the old-world fable of his miraculous inspira-

would be steadily brought to bear on ,the great objects of early
religious life. We may douthess‚ without much compunction,
discard the tales of Caedmon’s strangely-timed “ inspiration‚”
and J ohn's miraculous performanceS, as simply due to the
legend-loving temper and quality 01 the times wherein the record
was compiled3 but there will still remain more than enough to
show that good men and true were working with 1110111 01111 pen
and hand and life, and that their spirit, and will, and energy of
working were fostered and guided, as well as inspired from the
fountain-head of Hilda’s monastery at Streoneshalch.

Hilda appears to have died in the year 680, 01111 she was
succeeded by her royal pupil AElfleda, whn, for several years
after she became AbbesS, had not only the benefit of her mother's
presence and support in the discharge of her onerous duties, but
