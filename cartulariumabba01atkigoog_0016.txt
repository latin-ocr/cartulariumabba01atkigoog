xii PREFACE.

in possession of the lords of Whitby. Possibly‚ or
more than possibly, the entries in the foremost, page
of Sir O. Strickland's copy, dated respectively 1671

and 1683, may suggest, that up to that time suchlike
ancient, relics were carefully preserved, and from time

to time officially inspected. The thanks of the Society
are specially due to Sir Charles Strickland for his kind
courtesy in placing his book, and whatever other
ancient documents 116, stin retainS, in the editor’s
hands for the purposes of the present volumes. The
editor has also *oo¹ thank the Rev. W. Greenwell‚ Canon
Raine, Professor stubbs, and another friend who does
not wish a public acknowledgment, for their kind and
valuable assistance in compiling the present volumes.
But especially are his thanks due to William Brown,
of Arncliff Han, Esq.‚ for his unwearied kindness and

diligence in transcribing‚ collating, and working up
references. It was by this gentleman that the editor's
copy was collated with the Museum copy so far as the
charters, etc„ in each were coincident, and that copies
of the charters not in the Whitby copy were made for
future collation by the editor himself. Overburdened
as the editor is by the toils and careS, clerical and -
secular, of a very large parish, the present volumes
could not have seen the light for many a day—perhaps
even years—had it not been for Mr. Brown's dis-
interested‚ painstaking, and most efficient, as well as
long-continued help.
