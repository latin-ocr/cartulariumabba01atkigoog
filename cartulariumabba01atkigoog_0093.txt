PRELIMINARY NOTIOE To THE READER.

IN editing the present book it was possible to proceed on
one of two, or even three, different principles or plane. In the
Whitby copy no order of time whatever is observed by the old
transcribere, and, as noted in the Preface, order of locality or
place is only partially regarded. Order of place is more care-
sully attended to in the Museum copy, but still by no means
without noteworthy or extensive exceptione. Order of subject,
again, is not too carefully regarded in either copy. Royal con-
firmations are by no means all brought together, neither are
Archiepiscopal or Papal confirmations. Even the charters
by the various members of the Percy family are scattered
about in various parts of the collection. An entire rearrange-
ment of all the charters and other documenta according to date
was, in the case of a series, the majority of which could only be
inferentially or approximately dated, obviously so arduous an
undertaking as to be practically impossible.¹ An entire re-
arrangemmt, on the principle of grouping together all the
documents connected with the several different localities con-

¹ This is the principle on which Charlton has proceeded in his dealings
with the contente of the Whitby copy. A very small measure of acquaint-
ance with the subject-matter of his book is quite sufficient to disclose the
eminently unsatisfactory results of his arbitrary mode of alleging the more
οι· less specific dates of the various documenta as they come under hand.
