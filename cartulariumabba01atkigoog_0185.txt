¹ M. gives no witnesses’ names.

² M. Snetons. The lady here named is probably s grsnddaughter of John
Arundel, grsntor of the last charter, though her father Reginsld is nowhere
mentioned ss the son oi the said John. Stin, by inference from the descent
of the lordship of Sneton sud the suecession οἱ dates, such s conclusion is
quite consistent with resson ss well as probability. There was also sn
Osbert ArundeL who may have been brother to Reginald, or even uncle ; but
this is merely hypothesis. Johanna Arundel was st least twice married.
In No. 460 she speaks οἱ one Richsrd Vertdos as her “D’nus et sponsus,’'
while in No. 134 she describes herself ss, when she grants that charter,
‘⁴ Uxor Rogeri de Bsyuse,” one of the witnesses to the char-ter, moreover,
being Roget Arundel, her brother. 1 sm disposed to think the Baius
marriage was the first ; sud thst she granted the present char-ter, and N 0.
457 also, during her widowhood‚ is apparent from the terms of either.
Probably Agnes de Beyus, who, in 1252, enters into a convenit with the
Abbey (No. 461), was her daughter by the Baius marriage. As to the
probable descent of Roger de Baius see under N 0. 134.
