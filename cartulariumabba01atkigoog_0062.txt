But, however this may be, it is by no means impossible that
this circumstance— what 1 have termed the supersession of
Prior Serlo by Abbot William——may help to throw a little
light on more than one obscure point in the early history of
the resuscitated monastery. The alleged or pseudo-Stephen
states that, after a measure of success and prosperity had
begun to wait on his efforts as Prior—that is, after he had
relieved Reinfrid of that office—to repair and restore matters in
and about the monastery, “ one of the barons of the king,
namely, William de Percy, who had been the original donor of
the place''—Stephen says, “ to us,” though admittedly he only
joined the community some time after the gift had been made to
Reinfrid‚ and taken advantage of by him moreover-seeing the
improvements effected, began now to assail the brotherhood
directly and indirectly, and even strove to drive them forth by
every available means3 and he repeats the charge in still wider
terms a few lines further on.

Yet another writer¹ is there, moreover‚ who enlarges on the
violence and injustice of William de Percy displayed towards
the rising Whitby community, but, from our entire ignorance of
who he was and when he wrote, it is difficult to estimate the
measure of authority which might be supposed to go with his
statements. He says that, after the temporary retreat of the
Whitby monks to Hackness (of which more at a later page)
“ a very great strife arose between the two brothers William de
Perci and Ser10, Prior of Whitby,'' occasioned by the circum-
stance that the former had given the ville of Stachesbi² and
Everley to Radulphus de Everley, “ armigero suo qui annis
multis serviebat,” and that really William de Percy desired to
take away from Serlo all the lands and vills he had previously
given to the monastery. He says further that SerIO, on ascer-
taining this, goes with all speed to the king, trusting to his
former intimacy and friendship with him when both were
young soldiers in the house and court of the Conqueror. He
states that Rufus gave strict charge to William de Percy, “ ut

known place, and Scaxby does not. The legend, if legend it be, would con-
nect itself with some place in the Whitby possessione.
