stood upon. It will be remembered that the Abbess Hild‚
‘⁴ comparata possessione decem familiarum in loco qui dicitur
Streuneshalch ibi Monasterium construxit.’' Taking the usual
estimate of about 30 to 33 acres¹ to a familia or hide, we have
between three and four carucates to allow for, as a part of the
original “appurtenances” of the Anglo-Saxon monastery, and
it is surely not too much to assume that at least a portion of
this—and a half of it would very nearly make up the two
carucates specified as the amount of the original gift—would
be given with the site of the ruins, still leaving a balance of
nearly two carucates to be subsequently granted—on whatever
grounds or for whatever reason—to the person who either was
at the time of the grant Abbot of York, or subsequently be-

no reasonable doubt that Stephen of Whitby was the man
designated by the Domesday title “ Abbas de Ebor','’ and that
he actually held the vills of Prestebi and Sourebi in the

was publicly and unjustly wrested from them, “jam publice et

seek the King's protection (said to have been successful, moreover), he yet
alleges, “Exarsit qnippe ex eo tempore multo vehementius adversum nos
