in s position to grant s confirmation of s benefaction by Robert de Maium, or
to make s further eoncession of property within the limite of the Mninill
barony. As already notioed (Not-es to No. 34), cuthbert, who stands first
among the witnesses‚ had oeased ιο be prior of Gysburne before 1181,
having become prior between 1147 snd 1153. All the information we have
about Prior Hervisius in Bur-ton, is that he ruled before 1196. His Priory
was founded by Bertrsm de Bulmer, the last named among the witnesses
except Ernsld de Percy. He was still living in 1163. Ernald de Perey was
living in 1165, but, ss there is reason to believe, vves dead before 1170, i'or
‘⁸ Adam de Brus r. e. de eoL marcis pro haeredibus Roberti de Perny, quos
habet in custodis sua, pro habenda terra Ernardi de Percy, avunculi eorum ''
(16 Henry 11.). Robert de Perey and Ernsldus were the two sons of Ernald
de Peroy, who, with him, were witnesses to the conventio between Gyse-
burne and Whitby [No. 2711. This would bring the date of the present deed
between 1154 and 1170. Now Stephon de Maium, probably grandson of
Robert de Maium primus —- if not, his son — married Sibilla, sister of
Stephen de Bulmer, and is said to have died in 1191. There is some
unoertsinty in the Meinill pedigrees ss to which Stephen it was that
married into the Bulmer family. But a charter of Bobert de Meinill ιι, on
f. 263 of the Gysbnrne Chartulery, settles the question, inssmueh as the first
of the witnesses is “Stephano de Bulmer, avunculo meo.” But still, in the
absence of any special explanation of the feet, it is difficult to account for the
powers involved in the present deed as possessed by merely a brother-in-law
oi the then baron. Neither is the identification of the Stephen de Bulmer
under mention with the Stephon in the notes to No, 224 a matter of cer-
tainty. It is probable, perhaps3 as dee, assuming Dugdale’s data to be
verifisble and trnstworthy, that Bet-trem and Stephon were contemporaries,
possibly brothers. Dngdsle makes Bet-tram de Bulmer Sheriff of Yorkshire in
1140, 11δῇ end 1165, end he makes return of his fees in 1165 as above
noticed. Stephon, heard of in 1161,-2‚-3‚ also makes like and independent
returns in 1165, snd makes psyment on them in 1163, but is suoeeeded by
his son Thomas before 1 173. The whole question requires investigation.
