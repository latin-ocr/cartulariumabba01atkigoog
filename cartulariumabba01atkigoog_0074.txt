lxx INTRODUCTORY OHAPTERS.

would bring us to 1082, in which year William came to Eng-
land from Normandy to arrest the Bishop of Baieux, returning
thither again not long after. I note this because the next
important feature in the tale, as told by the alleged Stephen, is
that William de Perci, after this double consecration of Stephen
as Abbot, became more virulently and actively hostile than
ever to these unhappy religione, and strove by all possible
means to expel the community from Whitby; on which
account the Abbot had repeated recourse-—“ frequenter adire
compulsus est ''—to the justiciars, dinned his troubles into the
ears of many, asking of them help against his oppressore,
actually crossed over to Normandy in order to have an audi-
ence of the King, and finally, confronting William de Perci
there, besought the royal succour against him. And so, at
last, having accomplished his purpose—‘⁴ accepto pacis chiro-
grapho ''—he returns home. But the peace was of short dura-
tion. William de Perci showed himself more fiercely hostile
and bent upon their ruin than ever3 and, in the issue, suc-
ceeded in openly effecting their expulsion.

But surely all this must carry us on a year or two further
in the passage of time3 and thus, on our very modest assump-
tions as to the space of time required, we come to an epoch
which can certainly with no reason be supposed to antedate
the Domesday inquiry by much more than a couple of yearS,
within which period the appointment and consecration as Abbot
of York must necessarily be made, and moreover the grant and
concession, and by the very baron represented as so implacably
hostile, of the lands of Prestebi and Sourebi‚ he formally made
to the object of his hitherto persistent and bitter persecution.¹

¹ The suspicion has certainly crossed my mind that there might be a
possible connection between the Domestlay statement and the mention in
Stephen's narrative of his appeals to the justiciam and others. But inde-
pendently oi the fact that the whole narrative appears to me to be open to
so much and so grave suspicion, 1 cannot see any good ground for enter·
taining any such ides. In other words, 1 have no doubt that the Domesday
entry recorda a bona fide tenancy, and that it is, if understood to apply to
the grant of lands by William de Perci, entirely destructive of any faith in
the veracity of that part of the alleged Stephen’s narrative which speaks oi
the church·lands at Whitby as being publicly and unjustly torn from the
community οἱ religious so recently revived.
