Endowment chat-ter, appetu-ing mox-cover in both copies of the said chartei·
at the commencement of the Chertulary, that in 1119 the see in question
was in the hande of william Engdram, and the presumption ie that he was
the father of John, who, in the confirmation by Peter de Brun 11. of an the
donatione which the men of his fee had made to Gyeburn, ie named ae the
givet of the eameate epecified in the Foundation chat-ter. Probably thie
implies more than merely a subsequent confirmation by John Yugelrnm—
rather that he united with his (Ὶ) father in the gift, or that the father died
eo soon after the Foundation charter- was executcd that John Yngelmm
became desacto the donor of the cernente in question. Contempomry with
John Yngelrnm‚ et or about 1130-1135, was Walter Ingdrtm, sub-feudatory
of Rrue, ae John wne nt Amnum and Middleeburgh, nt Ingelby Amoliffe, and
the question of relationehip between them, ee ιο ite existence md itu degree,
naturally suggestu ituelf. Quite possibly they were brothere, a view not
discredited by the fact that Walter'e eon and heir was alno called Wiuiam.
That there wne nome connection between John and Walter, whether that of
brotherhood οι· not, is rendered more probable by the fect that Rnbertue
