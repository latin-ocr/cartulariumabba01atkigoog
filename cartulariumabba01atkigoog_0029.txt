INTRODUCTORY OHAPTERS. xxv

inaccurate nor misleading. Assuming Freeman’s statement as
to the amount of the last assessment of Danegeld during the
Conqueror’s reign 1—name1y, 63. per hide-to be valid, and
that for such practica] purposes as the present calculation the
carucate contained about three hides, and that, in Freeman's
words, “ along with the Danegeld, a tax which was strictly a
tax upon the land, came the aide of the towns, an impost
which has been held to be in effect the Danegeld levied on
those parts of the kingdom to which the reckoning by hides
could not apply ;'’ then we have this remarkable result :—
Lofthouse, with its 51 carucates containing about 153 hides,
each rated at 6s., was geldable at 1545, l8s. the balance
making up the 248 named in Domesday, being, it is presumed,
due on the town. Stokesley, with 40} carucates, or about 1 21
hides, at 63. 3 hide, ought to have been rateable at 5336, 6s.,
but was actually geldable at only 224 (however that fact is to
be accounted for): Hutton Rudby, with its 26 carucates, or 7 8
hides, was rateable at 5321, 18s., leaving a balance of 222, 2s. to

make up the Domesday value of 5243 while Whitby, with ⁴

43} carucateS, equivalent to about 130 hides, at 63. 3 hide,
would return ³:39, leaving a balance of some 167 3 to be made
good by the aid from the town and port3 a conclusion which
sorely militatae against the idea that the town, as well as the
monastery, lay in 111111 and desolation all through the two
hundred years alleged.

Before finally leaving the question thus discussed, there 13
one other remark I would fain make, somewhat retrospective in
its nature, and founded on a statement which is met with in
the “ Memorial of Benefactions,'’ touching the last condition of
111111 which had undoubtedly befallen the monastery. Speak-
ing of the grant of the “ hallowed place ’⁹ to Reinfrid, the first
Prior, by William de Perci‚ the writer mentions a fact which is
not without significance as to what the foundation had become
before that great ruin had fallen upon it. “ There were at that
time,'' he says, ‘⁶ in the said vill, as ancient countrymen have
delivered to us, about forty cells or oratories, only the walls of
which, however, together with the disused and shelterless
altars, remained.” Now, from this we may gather something
