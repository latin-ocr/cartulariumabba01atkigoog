¹ “Occurs before 1181 ” (Bm-ton). He is a witness to the confirmations
by Archbishop Roger (Nos. 44 and 55), in the present volume.

² Appointed 1203- 21219. Le Neve (iii. 230) says, “Bernard, according
to Godwin, succeeded Aldulf es Bishop of Cal-liele, but neither the time of
his accession nor that of his death is known. Godwin supposes that he died
in 1186, as Hoveden states that when Henry 11. was at Carlisle in that year,
‘ he caused one Paul of Leeds to be elected Bishop of Carlisle, who declined
the dignity.' The late ΜΓ. King (Handbook of the Catltedrals, p. 220) says
Adelulf was bishop llas-1156, and that, “after the death of Adelulf the
succession of Bishops becomes very uncertain. A certain william is named
as Bishop of Carlisle in 1174, and for some time the see was vacant, probably
owing to its scanty endowment, until 1203, when Bet-nard, who had been
Archbishop of ngusa, was appointed to it. The year of his death is un·
known. In 1219 Hugh, who had been Abbot of Beaulieu‚ was Bishop, who
continued till 1223.”

Le Neve, in a note, adds, ‘⁴ There is considerable doubt whether there
ever was a Bishop called Bernard. The mistske seems to have srisen from
the fact that Bernard, Archbishop of Slavonie, had a grant of the revenues
from King John ;” and in the text he says, “The See appears to have been
vacant until the appointment of Hugh, Abbot of Beaulieu, as Bishop of
Carlisle in 1218. But, during the long vscancy, King John granted the
revenues of the See to the Archbishop of Slavonia in 1200, and in 1205 to
Alexander de Lucy. The custody of the See was also granted to Aymery,
Archdeacon of Dux-ham, and afterwards, in the same year, to the Prior of
Carlisle.'’ But, from the documents now before us, there can but little
doubt be left that there was a Bishop Ber-nard fulfifflng episcopal duties.
The date of the present deed, from the facts as to time connected with the
witness who stands second in order (symon, Dean of York), must be anterior
to 1214. ³ monachii&
