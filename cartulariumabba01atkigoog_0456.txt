4

new series of publicatione under the old name and upon the
old lines, but with a. fresh numbering and some other token
of difference. The stock of the old publicatione iu the
possession of the Society is so greatly reduced that it is
by no means easy, and it will soon be impossible, to supply
full sets of our works to any new members who may wish to
acquire them.

In Sir Walter Calverley Trevelyan the Society has lost,
it may be said, one of its founders, a, gentleman who for
more than half a century has been a friend of scholare, and
a sympathizer and helper in literary work throughout the
North of England. There are now but four names upon our
list of members which stood there at the foundation of the
Society in 1834.
