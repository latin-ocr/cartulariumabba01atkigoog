and William de Percy are witnesses, the King explicitly con-
cedes and confirms to the church of Whitby and Prior Ser10,
over and above like liberties with those of the churches of
Ripon‚ Beverley and St. Peter of York‚ the church of St. Peter
at HackneSS, as well as two carucates of land in the same vill,
four more at N ordfeld, and two in Briniston, together with
“ saca and socna,'’ and immunity from Danegeld as to the said
lands3 the language as regards the church being unmistakably
that· of a confirmation, and not of an original grant.¹

It is· almost idle to say that it seems by no means improbable
—for the inference is almost forced upon us-—that Hackness‚
or, to speak more specifically, the church of St. Peter there,
with its patrimony or appurtenances—of whatever extent the
latter may have been—was looked upon from the first as among
the matters of property or possession appertaining to St. Peter’s
of Whitby. Hugh of Chester confirmS, or at least concedes, to
Prior Reinfrid and his convent, the church of St. Peter of
Whitby and all things which pertain to it ;2 and it is certainly
easier to connect the grants by the Conqueror and William de
Percy⁸ of land at Hackness with a monastic church already

¹ ‘⁴ Concedo etiam et confirmo eidem Ecclesiae de Whiteby (ie. Ecclesia! S.
Petri de Presteby et de Whiteby et Serloni Priori et monachis ibidem Deo
servientibus) ecclesiam S. Petri de Hachanessa, et in eadem villa ii carucatas
terrae, et in Nordfeld iv, et in Briniston ii, cum saca et socna, et sine omni

geldo.’'

² The wording is, “et omnia quae ad eam pertinent,” in place of the
customary “cum omnibus suis appendiciis,’' and so far the verb is “con-
cessi ;’' and then to the said monks and their ehurch he further makes the
gift or grant of (⁶⁸dedi'’) the church οἱ Midlesburg (written Fleinesburg) and
its tithes. The words “omnia quae ad eam pertinent '² are of wide extent,
and may well include not only (as they, 1 think, certainly did) the Port and
its accompanying rights, etc„ but what had been one of the most important
portions of the property of the old foundation-namely, Hackness and its
monkish church, which one, at least, of the three named in Domesday as still
in being theu, clearly was.

⁸ 1 think it is important to note that from the language and tenor of the
charters themselves, quite independently of any other source of information
or deduction, there were at least, so to speak, two periods of benefactiou on
the part οἱ william de Porci—the first, which is marked by the, in part,
confirmator-y char-ter of the Earl of Chester ; the second, which is designated
by his own charter, to which his wife, his heir Alani, aud his other sous
Walter and William, as well as Archbishop Thomas oi York‚ are described
