noticed the obscurity involving the precise date of the death ²
of the former, and it is quite evident that he regards the suc-
cession of William de Percy as consequent on the death of
Serlo; that, in fact, it never entered into his mind to suppose
any other sequence of events. Charlton's language is as pre-
cise as possible in delivering the same view, and still with his
characteristic dogmatism in the affixing of dates. “ Serlo,'’ he
writes, “ continued to preside with great reputation as Prior
in the Monastery of Whitby, for almost twenty years, and died
about the year 1102. . . . He was succeeded‚ as Prior of
Whitby, by his nephew William.'' ²

Only a small measure of attention to the terms actually
employed by the Memorialist—the only authority I believe
either assumed or available by these two writers—will be suffi-
cient to prove that if any statement of the kind is made, it is
that Serlo remained Prior only until he was superseded by
William as Abbot. Whether William was put over his head
in the new dignity acquired for the House of Whitby, while
he still remained in the now subsidiary post of Prior, or
whether he resigned the office altogether and ceased to bear
any prominent part in the rule of the House, we may have no
absolutely positive grounds for deciding3 although, as will be
more fully seen in the sequel, we are not quite without means
for arriving at a fairly satisfactory conclusion.

¹ Whitby, pp. 253, 257.
² Whitby, p. 62. The author continues his statement thus =—“ Who had

ior several years lived as a canon or monk there, and was unanimously
elected by the whole fraternity.” Charlton has no authority whatever for
making the latter part of this statement. It may be true, or it may not,
but it rests on no testimony. And it is one of a thousand others in
Charlton's volume of which the same may be said. As to the former part
οἱ it, he overlooks the difference between monh and canon ; he is with-
out authority for stating that “ william de Percy Canonicus '’ had lived
at Whitby for several years ; and he further over-looks the fact that will.
de Percy Canonicus was still described in those terme in the time of Robert,
son of Falco Dapifer son of Reinfrid, the Prior, or, in other words, long
atter (even according to Charlton’s autocratic mode of dating, and much
more according to the statement of the Whitby Memorialist) Abbot william
de Percy had commenced his period of headship. There is very little doubt
that William de Percy, the canon, was a brother of Alan de Percy, and son
of william de Percy hote Lesgernuns ‘⁶ The Founder,” and consequently
cousin to Abbot William. See note 3 to No. 89.
