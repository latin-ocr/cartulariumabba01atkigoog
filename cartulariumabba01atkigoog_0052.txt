Reinfrid, and necessarily some time before the Conqueror’s
decease.

For that the confirmations ascribed to Williarn the Conqueror
—one of which moreover is so ascribed in both the Strickland
and Museum copies of the Chartulary ¹—are correctly assigned to
him there really can be no reasonable doubt at all, Dr. Young's
authority notwithstanding. In the first place, to give but one
instance of the kind, Henry 1., in a char-ter of confirmuion
granted by him between 1133 and 1135,² confir-ms to the
church of Whiteby-—“ omnes terras et ecclesias et decimas, et
omnes possessiones quas Willelmus Rex, pater meus, et Willel-
mus Rex, frater meus, eidem ecclesiae dederunt et per cartas suas
confirmaverunt.” It is therefore absolutely certain that Wil-
liam the Conqueror, as well as william Rufus, not only made
concessions, but granted charters to Whitby. But further it is
certain that, granting that the Conqueror conceded one of the
confirmations ascribed to him, he granted the other also; for
in the Inspeximus of Edward 11. (No, 582) after recital of the
confirmation which, as above noted, is ascribed to William 1.
in both chartularios, the document continues “Inspeximus etiam
quandam aliam cartam quam idem progenitor noster fecit
eisdem ,Abbati et monachis in haec verba z—Willelmus Rex
Anglorum '1¹[homae] Archiepiscopo et Alano Comiti et R . . . .
Paganell0‚ etc.” rehearsing the charter found on f. 153 of the
Additional MS. Chartulary (N o, 555), the witnesses to which are
Archbishop Lanfranc, Osmund Bishop of Salisbury, and
William de Perci, and the object of which charter is to secure
to Whitby the same privileges as those enjoyed by the several
churches of St. John at Beverley, St. Wilfred at Ripon, and
St. Peter at York, besides granting and confirming the Church
of St. Peter at Hackness, two carucatas of land in the same vill,
four more in Nordfeld, and two others in Briniston.

two carucatas and two bovata· at Newham‚ co-ordinately with new ecclesi-
utical conditione attaching to the Middlesbnrgh Chnrch.

¹ The rubricated heading to one of them in the Strickland copy is ‘¹ cm·
Regis willelmi primi Regis Angliae de libertatibus Abbatiae de Witebi.”
In the Musenm copy the heading is “Car-ta primi Regis willelmi de
libertatibus concessis Ecclesia de Witeby antequam Abbas ibi esset.''
