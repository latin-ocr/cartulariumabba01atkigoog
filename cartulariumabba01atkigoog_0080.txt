King Williarn's confirmations, the possessions of the renascent
monastery, so far as we have any certainty, may be thus stated:
—The ancient monastery with its site, ruined oratories, the
church of St. Peter, and two carucates of land in Prestebi‚
together with all things which appertained to the said church
of St. Peter3 the church of Midelsburg, with all its tithes,
“ F rancigenis et Anglicis ;'' the church of St. Peter at HacknesS,
certain carucates of land in the same vill, the number not quite
certain, of William de Perci's see, two other carucateS, in the
same place, of the Royal demesnes‚ together with other carucates
in N ordfeld, and two more in Burniston springing from the same
source, with all their various appurtenanceS, besides the rights
of sac and soke, and immunity from Danegeld ; certain forests
and forest rights within their own peculiar limits; the port of
Whitby with its various rights ; and aISO, besides all the various
ecclesiastical liberties and immunities like to those possessed
by the three great religious foundations of Reverley, Ripon
and St. Peter’s at York, ⁸the fullest rights, liberties‚ free
customs and immunities which the Royal power could bestow
in other matters.

Moreover, the mention made in Williaiu's charter touching
the lands, forests and woodland beasts (“ silvestribus bestiis '’)
“intra terminos suos? and of the “ aquae eorum in Portu de
Wyteby,'’ lends some tangible significance to the statement made
by the Memorialist, that William de Perci‚ when the number
of the monks continued to increase at Whitby‚ and his brother
Serlo had been made a monk there (“ ibi monachus fuisset
effectus''), gave them “ villas, terras, ecclesias et decimas in perp.
elemosinam.” The fact is so likely in itself, that, uncertain as
we are what were the then limits of the lands and other
possessions of the monastery, it is quite impossible to treat the
statement in question as a mere rhetorical effusion on the part
