¹ No other witnesses in Μ. ² qenai.

³ Not certain whether Hernant or Her-naut.

⁴ A name of doubtful form.

⁵ The large capital at the head of this deed, in red, is R. A smaller
capital, G„ is insemd close after it. The heading leaves no doubt of what
the letter should be. As to the identity of the person intended, it would
seem difficult, and perhaps unnecessary, to identify him with the Guy de
Baliol named by Dugdale, and of whom he says that, ‘⁶ in the reign of Wil-
liam Rufus, he was enfeofl'ed by that King in the barony of Biwen in Nor-
thumberland‚” adding further—and by such addition bringing him into
local connection with the place named in the charter—that he ‘⁶ gave to the
Abbey of S. Mary at York the church of Stokesley and one carucate of
land.’' After another sentence or two, describing other donatione to S.
Mary’s, Dngdale proceeds, ‘⁸ the next was Bernard Baliol‚ son of Guy, who,
in 3 Stephen, upon that great invasion by the Scots, met at Thresk, through
the instance of Thumtm, Archbishop of York, with other of the Northern
barone, etc.” Now the next char-ter (No. 53) is granted by Bernard de
BalioL but it will be observed that he speaks oi Gnido de Baliol-doubtless
the Guido of the present charter-—as his brother, and not as his father. Hence,
as Bernard de Baliol isin 1138 the important man Dugdale's notice proves
him to be, and as the Guy de Baliol of this charter was his brother, it would
appear to be a safe, if not a necessary, inference that the Guy de Baliol of
william Rufus’s time had a son Guy as well as a son Bernard, and elder than
Ber-nard, but that he died early and without heir, leaving his inheritance to
his brother Bernard, vvere it not that in No. 353 a Guido de Balliol appears
at the head of the witnesses to a cbarter by this same Bernard de Balliol.
Guido therefore must either have been the younger brother, subinfeuded to
Bernard, or bave ceded his rights. A further necessary inference is as to
the date of the gift by Adam filius Viel or Vitalis, noted in charters 51-54,
as well as in others: it must have been before 1138. Dngdale quotes Ber-
nard as still serving valiantly in arms in 20 Henr. 11. (1172), as giving certain
lande to the Knights Templars, with the consent of his son Ingelram, and as
