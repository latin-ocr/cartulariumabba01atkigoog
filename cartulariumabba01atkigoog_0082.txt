lxxviii INTRODUc‘roRY onAPTERs.

That such supersession did actually take place 1 think there
can be but little doubt. There is a charter by Nigel de Albini
(N 0. 261), the date of which lies between 1108-1114, by which
the grantor restores (“ reddidit '')¹ to Grod and the Church of All
Saints in Fishergate at York, a certain half carucate of land at
Tlmrp, with the explicit direction that Serlo the Prior and the
other monks of that same place (“ Serlo Prior et alii monachi
ejusdem loci”) should have and hold the same. And it is to be
remarked that while Whitby 13 not so much as named, or even
alluded to, in the terme employed, the Church of All Saints,
which it will be remembered had been granted by Rufus for
the establishment of a cell there, is both named and described
with more than the usual precision :--“ Deo et ecclesiae Omnium
Sanctorum . . . scilicet ecclesiae quae est in Fisergate apud
Eboracum.’' There can therefore be no doubt at all as to the
position Prior Serlo held at the time of this grant. The phrase
“ et alii monachi ejusdem 1001 ” can be understood but in one
way. Serlo had ceased to be Prior of Whitby,2 and had become
simply Prior of the Cell at the Church of All Saints in York.8

Nom such a change as this could have occurred but in one
of two ways—either by consent of Ser10, or against his will,
and as the result of influence brought to bear upon him of
such a nature, whether moral or compulsory‚ that he was
unable to resist it. In the latter case, the fact of the variance‚

² Some observations as to the probable date of the conversion of the
Priory into an Abbatial Honse will be found at a future page.

³ In close connection with this conclusion it 13 not ont of place to remark
that at a subseqnent period in the history of the Abbey, in fact not fifty
years later, a precisely similar retirement took place. When Abbot Benedict
resigned in 1148, we are told that the said Benedict, with the unanimous
consent of the chapter of monks, took up 1113 permanent abode at An Saints’
Call—‘⁸ permansit in ecclesia Omn. Sanctorum in Fishergatc apud Ebora-
cum '' (No. 3).
