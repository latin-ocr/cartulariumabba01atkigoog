censiS‚ sunt ii carucatae in dominio, et viii sochmanni cumi
caruca, et xxx villani cum iii carneis, et i molendinum x solid-
orum, et xxvi acrae prati per loca.''

The Domesday statement then is, that the Abbot of York
holds of William de Perci (William de Perci himself being a
subinfeudatory of Hugh of Chester, who is the tenant in
capite) Presteby and Soureby, containing, the former two
carucatas, and the latter four, liable to Danegeld, and by as
purely 88811181 8 holding as any other sub-tenant mentioned in
the account of the entire see. Further‚ in these two vills there
were two carucatas “ in domini00,'’ which alone, out of all the
forty-three carucates comprising the capital manor of Whitby
itself, its berewic Sneton, and its various sokes, formed an
exception to the miserable “ omnia wasta '' applicable to the
rest3 and on these two carucates eight sochmanni, with the
apparently pitiful equipment of one plough,1 and thirty villanes
with the more pitiful equipment of three ploughs in all, are
returned as finding employment and maintenance.

In the territory of Prestebi and Soureby then, comprising in
all six carucatas, there were, according to Domesday, two
carucatas not waste, and, in so far, unlike all the rest in the ’
entire manor; but there is no specification as to the precise
locality of these two carucatas, as being situate in 0118 of the
two vills rather than in the other, or jointly in both ; least of
all, any allegation that they were exclusively in that of Prestebi,
and just as little that these two were held by the Abbot in
frank almoigne.

The statement in the Memorial, in one place, is———“ dedit
autem illi (Renfrido) strenuissimus praedictus Willelmus de
Perci antiquum monasterium S. Petri Apostoli, cum duabus
carucatis terrae in Prestebi, in elemosinam perpetuam,'’ the
earlier mention of the 881118 fact having been thus expressed :—
“ in loco qui olim Streoneshalc vocabatur, deinde Prestebi
