under authority, having soldiers under him ;’' and that his rank
was not a very subordinate one there are other considerations
tending to show.

For instance, his son1 was obviously a man of some distinc-
tion as well as wealth. Charlton himself makes him out to
have been Dapifer— that is, as he explains it, ‘⁴ butler, or cup-
bearer ’'—to the family of de Arcubus; and this not only with
no better authority than the fact that he holds under Osbert
or Osbern de Arches (whose confirmation of his grant to
Whitby of two carucates in Tholestun is given in two separate
charters, Nos. 88 and 235),² but in the face of a direct state-
ment to the contrary made in the body of the Memorial. To
myself, even in the absence of such direct statement, yet from
his frequent presence at the execution of important charters by
members of the Percy family, it would always have appeared
more probable that he was Dapifer to the head of that great
family, in other words to Alan de Percy himself3 but the
question is set at rest at once by the simple entry in the
Memorial just referred to—namely, ‘⁴ ex dono Folconii, Dapi-
feri Alani de Perci, duas carucatas terrae in Thoulestune.'’⁸

¹ Charlton’s sagacity led him to infer that Fulco filius Raynfredi was a
son of Reinfrid the Prior (Whitby, p. 60), a fact that is placed quite beyond
doubt by the entry of his name iu full as “ Fulco Dapifer filius Reynfridi
Prioris de Whitby '’ among the witnesses to two of the char-tere rehearsed
in the Inspeximus of Henricus filius Henrici de Percy‚ found on f. 6 (or f)
in the Museum Chartulary.

² The terme employed in the one (No, 88) are “concedente d'no meo
Osberto de Arches,” and iu the other (N o. 253), “ consensu et licentia d’ni
mei Osberni de Arches.” Touehing the duplicate form of the name Osbert
or osbern, it may be noted that the same peculiarity is met with in the
Domesday record for Yorkshire. Thus, on p. ib (Facsimile copy), the form
Osbertus is met with; in the list of fees, p. fib, it is Osbern, as it is also in
the description of his fee, p. lxiii et seq„ and in the Clamores, p. lxxiV. In
N 0. 89 is a further confirmation by william de Arches.

⁸ “ In Toglestun et Neuueton et Oglestorp, habuerunt iiii taini . . . vii
carucatas terrae et vii bovatas. Nunc habet Falco, homo Osberni, ibi i caru-
catam et v villanos, cum i caruca et viii acras prati.

‘⁶ In Neuton et Oglestun‚ habuerunt v taini iii carucatas terrm ad
galdum. Terra est ad iiii carucae. Ibi Fulcho, homo Osberni‚ habet i
carucatam et vii villanos, cum ii carucis, et xvi acras prati et sectam i·
molendini.” -
