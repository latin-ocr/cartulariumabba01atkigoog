volume, called indiscriminately “ The Abbot's Book,'' “ The
Whitby Register,'’ or “ The Whitby Chartulary ”—which
writing dates most likely not much, if at all, below 1160, and
is described as the “ Memorial of Benefactions,” whereas the
newly-founded abbey is spoken of as situate “ in loco qui olim

Streoneshalc vocabatur, deinde Prestebi appellabatur, nunc vero
Witebi vocatur? still the first donation by William de Perci,
the founder, of two carucates of land—inclusive necessarily of
the site itself—is stated to have been at Prestebi; a statement
which, as is apparent, not only involves a contradistinction
between Witebi and Prestebi in 1070 —the latter being merely
the ancient (or Anglian) Streneshalc under a newer (namely a
Danish) name—but also proves that the name Witebi of 1 150-
11 60, when the restored Abbey had become the great distin-
guishing or characterising feature of the district, had come to
be a name absorbing within itself, and so superseding, the older
distinctive local name of Prestebi‚ just as the latter had itself,
some two or three centuries before, superseded the still older
name of Streneshalch.

For, as already intimated, there 18 110 doubt where the
Anglo-Saxon Monastery stood, and therefore no doubt where
“ the place which used to be called Streneshalc” had its locality,
even if the point were not settled by the short Latin extract
given a little above. The great “kitchen-midding'' which is
known to exist in so many places at the foot of the bank above
which slopes the “ Almary Field,'' is quite sufficient as an index
to the site of the domestic buildings of the elder monastery3
and, indeed, a very cursory glance at the brae of the said bank,
even without the remembrance of the runed Anglo·Saxon
comb found there (and now in the local museum), would go
very far towards enforcing the same conclusion3 it is full of
the matters which go to constitute what is understood by a
kitchen-midding.

Setting, therefore, side by side the certainty that the ascer-
tained site of Streanaeshalc was a level space girt in for many
hundred yards with precipitous cliffs —in other terms, a
“ heugh '’-and the philological probability, or more, that halch,
halo, hales, heuch, Iaeuqh, are only differing forms of the same
word, I think we have a more reasonable derivation of the
