Statutum est in curia Domini Regis Henrici, anno regni eui
xx⁰.‚ die Mercurii, in crastino Sancti Vincentii, apud Gelde-
ford coram domino E[admundo]⁸ Archiepiscopo cantuarensi, et
co-epiecopie⁴ suis, et coram majori parte Comitum et
Beronum Angliae pro communi utilitate totius regni Angliae,
quod de caetero omnes viduae, quae post mortem virorum suorum
expellantur de dotibus suiS, vel dotes suas et quarentenam
suam habere non possint sine placit0, et quae postea per placitum
dotes suas recuperaverint de tenementis de quibus viri earum

ency and quality. Π anything, the ink ie blacker and more gloeey in the
Memorial than in the other two documento under notice, though the eeeming
differ-enee may only depend upon the circumstance that the writing ie made
lar-ger, and the epacea between the linea much wider in the former than in
the latter. On the whole, 1 am inclined to think that possibly a epace of
a few year-e may have intervened between the penning of the larger writing
οἱ the Memorial and that of the other two entriee, aa aleo that the latter
were written very cloeely upon the date that ia laet mentioned, namely, in
the year 1176. Thia would throw the writing of the Memorial back to
about 1155 to 1165, which ia probably not far from the true date.

¹ According to the exieting paging of the Cholmley Regieter, or “ Abbot'e
Bookss’ which will hereafter be designated by the letter A—the Muaeum
copy being likewiee indicated by the letter M—the Cartulary begine here ;
and it may be remarked in passing that the handwriting on f l, and the
upper part of lb ia the same aa that on ἱ 8, and thenceforward with an
occasional blank page or leaf, and a rare insertion or two, to the bottom of
f. 71. The hand may probably be assigned ιο Abbot Roger’e time, or 1222-
1244.

¹ In the Record Commieaionere' edition of the Statua qt* tlte Realm, at the
end οἱ the Provieiona of Mer-ton, there ia a copy of the Cloee Roll of 20
Henry 111. (Τ. R. apud Gulddord xxx. die Januariij, which contains
the same clauaee aa in the text, and ie apparently the King’e direction to the
Sheriff to exeeute the clauaee ot the Merton Proviaiona. Except that it
read· “Curia ποθὴ-ιβ’ inatead of “ Curia Regie,” all the variatione are of a
niere clerical nort. The copy in the text seems ιο be a sort of rehem-eal of
the etatutory enactment, drawn from the writing to the Sheriff, but thr-own
into the statutory form. The Council at Merton vae held on the morrow of
St. Vincent, J annary 23. The writ ie dated J anuary 30 at Guildford, just a
week after. The extract may be from a Statute Roll, non-existent or lost.
or a redaction of a conventual scribe from the writ.

⁸ Written with only the initial E. ⁴ Written quoepiscopis.
