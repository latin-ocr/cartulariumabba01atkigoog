xxviii INTRODUOE'ORY CHAPTERS.

But, speaking plainly, the history of matters connected with
the restoration of Whitby at this time is a muddle. The account
given in the Memorial is inconsistent with, and in parts con-
tradictory of, that left by Stephen of Whitby; while the Domes-
day statement that the two carucatas in Prestebi and Sourebi
were held by the Abbot of York of William de Perci (the latter
holding all Whitby of Hugh Earl of Chester) is hard to accom-
modate with either account. What can be attempted towards
a possible reconciliation has been attempted in the second of
these Introductory Chapters, to which therefore the reader
must from this point be referred.

This, however, may be said: that it seems very doubtful
whether, at the date alleged—nearly coincident with that of
the Domesday returns—there was much living or actual mon-
astic work going on at Whitby at alL The residence of the
monastic party would seem to have fluctuated between Whitby
and Hackness, to say nothing of Stephen’s mention of Lasting·
ham as at one time a resting-place or refuge; and it was not
until some time after Serlo de Perci, brother of William de
Perci “ hote Lesgernuns‚'’ had become Prior, that Whitby
became in reality the monastic head-quarters. Fr0m this time
forth the growth of the Abbey in material means, and it is to
be presumed also in the accretion of the necessary buildingS,
became steady, and eventually rapid and very considerable.
Passing by the obscure transaction of the alleged original grant
at Prestebi and Sourebi, the more certain grant of the Church
of St. Peter at Whitby, with all its appurtenances, by Hugh
Earl of Chester, and (by the same charter) the grant of the
Church of Midlesburg with its tithes French and English—
passing all this by, we find the grant by William de Perci to
his brother Serlo of the vills of Whitby and Stainseker, of
Newham and Stakesby, of Hakaness and the Port of Whitby,
and of the Churches of St. Mary and St. Hilda at Hackness,
together with Northfield, Suffield, Everley, Brochesay, and
Thornley, with the tithes also of Uplethum, wilton, Chever-
mund, Ludeford, Covenham, Immingeham‚ Sumerledeby, Semar,
with half the fishery of Ergum, and all forests, woods, waters,
etc„ belonging to the said Church of Whitby3 and, thereafter,
gift and confirmation from Alan de Perci, son of William afore-
