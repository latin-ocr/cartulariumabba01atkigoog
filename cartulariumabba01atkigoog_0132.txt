1111, or earlier. On this supposition cospatric, Uchtred’s father, would be
the son of Cospatrio Comes. On the calculation οἱ 30 years to a generation,
we can only suppose that our Cospatrie was the Earl himself. It would be,
however, almost certain that, as Oospatric the second Earl had a son Uchtred,
the former calculation must be the one to be approved, were it not that the
grantor speaks of having hat-used the monks in the matter of the church in
question, which of course compels the conclusion that he was now more than
only just of age.

¹ In No. 261 Will. de Romario is named by Nigellus dc Albini as
“dominus suus et amicus.'’ Dugdale says oi him that in 1118 he was
governor oi the gai-rison of Newmareh in Normandy, but that in 1122 he
was in rebellion, but was reconciled to the king two years afterwards. He
founded the Abbey of Revesby in 1142.

² Many other witnesses’ names are given in the Inspeximns given below
[No. 313].

³ Roger de Pont l'Eveque, 1154-1181.

⁴ Reberti. Robert possessed the archdcaconry about 1160, and was wit-
ness, with the prior of the said church, to several deeds (Le Neve, iii. p. 248).
