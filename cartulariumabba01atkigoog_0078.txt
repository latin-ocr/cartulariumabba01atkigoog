Moreover, there is a further supposition which may be enter-
tained, and in this place, perhapS, without any incongruity, of
such a nature as to connect itself with this last, and not with
any tendency to invalidate it. I mean that amid all the
evident inconsistency with facts and with reason observed in
the alleged Stephen narrative, and in that supplied from
Dodsworth‚ there is one matter in which both agree, as to its
essentia] nature at all eventa, if not in its minor accessories of
time and person.1 I refer to the alleged plundering attacks of
pirates from the sea and robbers from the more immediate
vicinity which, in the one account, induced the primary retreat
to Lestingeham, and in the other led to the retirement to

only be surmised The fact, however, remains that when the list of fees in
Yorkshire, prefixed to the full specification of the various manors held by
the king and his several tenants in capite, was drawn up, the fourth in the
list, the first three being ‘⁴ i. Terra Regis. ii. Archiepiscopi Eboracensis
et canonicorum ac hominum ejus. iii. Ep'i Dunelm. et hominum ejus.’‘
“iiii. Abbatis de Ebora00‚” and next to it “v. Hugonis comitis.” In the full
specification or description of the mauors involved after “ i. Terra Regis‚’'
and before ‘⁸ ii. terra Arehiep‘i Eboraeensia,” are four entries under the
rubricated heading, not nmmhered, of “ Terra Archiep'i Eborac'.'’ After
this comes ‘⁸ iii. Terra Ep’i Dunelmensis,’' and then “iiii. Terra Hugonis
comitis ’² instead of “v. Terra Hugonis comitis ’' as in the prefatory list or
index. It is to be presumed that the list was made before the specification
was completed, and suffered to remain unaltered by an oversight 3 but even
soit conclusively shows that the fee of the Abbot of York was in some
sense an* entity even then, though not an entity ecc postfacto as all the other
twenty-eight fees named in the list were—that is, as being already enjoyed
by the several grantees named. · In all probability the entity of the Abbot’s
fee was dependent on the circumstance that it was in process of formation,
but not as yet fully formed, and that a variety of adjustments‚ re·leases,
re·grante, exchangea or grants in augmentation having to be made before a
final arrangement could be come to, it was found impossible, within the
limited time allowed by the urgent demands of the king for the completed
returns, to give the necessary details, ete„ the Abbot’s fee was finally
omitted as a several or special fee. As to the adjustments‚ re-leases, re-
grants, etc„ just named, some explanatory matter will be found in the text
at a subsequent page.

¹ The alleged Stephen speaks of one retreat consequent on the attacks of
pirates and robbers, and that in his own time and to Lestingham. The
Dodsworth authority speaks of two periods of such attacks, one in the time
of Prior Reinfrid‚ the other in that of Serlo, which latter witnessed the
retreat to Hackness.
